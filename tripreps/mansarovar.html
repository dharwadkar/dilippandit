        <h3>Day 1: Sunday 22 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            The date for which I was waiting for such a long time since my selection as Liaison Office (LO) in April has at last arrived. I shall be meeting yatris today at Hearts and Lungs Hospital on Panchkuian Road Delhi. I had been applying for this post for
            the last several years and I was fifth time lucky this year. I felt that if Lord Shiva wants me to come to His abode in Mount Kailash (MK), He would make conditions propitious for my selection. I was clear in my mind that if I were ever to
            go to MK and Mansarovar Lake (ML) it would be not because of my efforts but because of His inscrutable ways of getting things done in His own inimitable style. He also selects the time. I was certain that it was He who would make conditions
            favourable for my selection. It was His desire that I would be fulfilling if I were to be selected. Of course I would be doing all that was expected of me. Such as filling up form; getting for myself clearances and sanctions from government
            departments and appearing for interview in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).
        </p>
        <p>
            The sky was overcast. It had probably rained a little in the morning, as the dried droplets on cars seemed to suggest. I noticed them on my way to the neighbourhood park in the morning for my customary morning walk. Did some yoga and pranayama exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was on the way to the Hospital at about 10. I dressed casually to lend an air of informality to my interactions with yatris. Looked forward to meeting them. They would be my companions for the next one-month. They had agreed to place both their fate
            and faith in my hands on the advice and directive of Ministry of External Affairs that had selected me as pilgrims’ LO. A slew of questions crossed my mind. In what health would they be? What would be their fears and concerns? What kind of
            bonding would result as a result of this yatra? What could possibly be their age profile? I was going to be their LO and what did they expect from me? I had no clue to the answers of these questions at this stage. Will I ever have all the
            answers to the questions? I do not know.
        </p>
        <p>
            These thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of car at the hospital. As I entered the main gate I espied Mr. Joshi PRO (Public Relations Officer) of
            <a href="http://kmvn.in/" target="_blank">Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd. (KMVN)</a> authoritatively sitting behind a desk arranged thoughtfully by the Hospital at a conspicuous place in the reception area meant for patients and their relatives.
            He was helping yatris generally and collecting their passports for getting group visa from the Chinese embassy. Mr. Joshi was dark, in early forties and had red teeth that suggested his addiction to that typically south Asian habit of chewing
            betel leaves. I had met him earlier and found him to be amiable. Mr. Joshi informed me that only 34 yatris have reported for medical examination. I was exultant. Smaller the group, better the management, I thought in my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then began a series of informal meeting with Yatris who were going about their business of getting themselves medically examined at different places in the hospital. All yatris could be identified by the red ribbon that had been pinned to their shirts
            or sarees. I was astonished to see a lean old man in white cotton shirt and dhoti with gray cropped hair walking briskly from one place to another. He appeared to be in either late sixties or early seventies. He was as straight as a ramrod
            and as lean as a reed. I made a mental note of this yatri as probably the oldest of the lot. A few yatris were sitting at a coffee counter chatting among themselves. When I walked up to them and introduced myself, a few were genuinely pleased
            while others were relieved. Don’t know why? A majority of Yatris appeared to be from Karnataka; from Bangalore and Mysore. It appeared to me that ladies were more than gents. But I was wrong in this assumption. Average age of Yatris? Around
            45+. All of them were in the last stages of physical and mental preparation of yatra. I was glad that my batch was small and easy, so it seemed from whatever discussions I had with them. The purpose of my meeting them was to initially break
            the ice and get to know them better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Joshi in his typical officious manner asked whether I got my passport with me. Since I had not been advised to bring it with me, I could not give him one. He advised me to deliver it to Mr. Dalpati of MEA direct tomorrow by 11 so that action for obtaining
            group visa could be taken by him.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was getting close to noon when I left yatris to their devices and went home.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 2: Monday 23 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            In the morning Mr. Dalpati called on my cell to inform me that he needed my passport urgently. I told him that I would come and give it to him by 11.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dropped in at MEA and handed over my passport to Dalpati. He asked me to collect the Satellite Phone in the afternoon. The man was pleasant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Went to Tigri Camp of Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) where Yatris were summoned for further medical examination. Those who were declared medically fit were obviously elated, while those who were not fit were disappointed. About 4-5 yatris were referred
            to Batra Hospital for a second opinion. Here I got further opportunity to mingle with the yatris. After the examination was over, all the yatris were called to the first floor hall, where lunch for them was arranged by a Non-Governmental Organization
            (NGO). We were given water, lemon juice and a well-organized lunch that included I think gulab jamuns. We were also given waist strap pouch containing Maggi soup powder, Nescafe pouches, and puja samagri. This was preceded by recitation of
            prayers to Lord Shiva. After one NGO had gone others came and gave yatris lectures on how to look after oneself during the yatra.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got bored with all this stuff and did a disappearing act. I was later informed that the NGOs had also given rations to the yatris for preparing food in China in four big sacks. Even a medical kit was given that contained, among essential medicines,
            a stethoscope and a BP instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I was leaving the Base Hospital a young man whom I did not recognize accosted me. He said that he would be leaving his old parents in my care during the yatra, and although he did not say it but from the way his eyes spoke, I understood that he
            wanted some words of assurance from me that they would be looked after well. I made some reassuring noises that seemed to satisfy him. It was then that I realized the enormity of responsibility that I had assumed and felt terribly humbled.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 3: Tuesday 23 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            The day had been set apart for briefing by the MEA at Hotel Akbar from where a few offices of MEA and Ministry of Overseas India Affairs function. While we all were waiting in the compound of the hotel for someone in authority come and take us inside,
            I noticed a young girl in about mid thirties, in tight jeans and black t-shirt standing at the entrance. She had a round face. Her hair fell freely over her shoulders. She clutched a file in her hands and was generally waiting for someone
            or something. I later on found out that she was the one who was invited by KMVN to brief yatris that day. She has, it seemed gone to KM a number of times and enchanted by her experience, given up her job in an MNC and was organizing trips
            to KM via Nepal.
        </p>
        <p>
            We all were shepherded to the conference hall that had the capacity to sit about 70. I, this girl, Mr. Joshi, and Dalpati were on dais and were later on joined by Mr. Anil Kumar Under Secretary (EA) of MEA.
        </p>
        <p>
            The girl made her points forcefully and said that the religious significance of the yatra must never be lost sight of. We must make an attempt to shed our cultural, and regional identities, ego, vanity and prejudices in order to truly benefit from that
            Yatra. Then she advised all the yatris how to look after themselves and in what spirit must the trekking in the Himalayas be undertaken. She also gave a day-to-day account of the yatra and what to expect on those days.
        </p>
        <p>
            After her briefing was over, I also spoke to the yatris for a few minutes. I told them that I felt honored to be their LO and looked forward to spending the next one month with them. I further advised them that they should not hide any discomforts from
            me. I said that I looked forward to their cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the briefing, all the yatris paid Rs.15500/- to KMVN and that took a long time. Meanwhile I slipped out of the Akbar Hotel and went to Ashoka Hotel (HA) from where dollars were to be purchased. The man at the Central Bank of India’s counter in HA
            was perhaps looking forward to an early lunch and appeared to be annoyed to see me. There was only one man waiting for his turn. Since he was taking a very long time to fill up the form, the manager allowed me to jump the queue. He quickly
            gave me a form to fill for drawing foreign exchange. I filled it up. I took US$ 900 at the exchange rate of Rs.41.20 to a dollar. While leaving him I forewarned him to expect a group of about 30 yatris to descend on his branch for collecting
            foreign exchange. He said he would have enough dollars for 30 if not more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, I went to the Connaught Place (A popular shopping area in New Delhi) and bought a 2 GB memory card for the camera. It was Nikon A 400 with 3.2 MP. The card cost me Rs.1250. Then I went home and started packing for the trip.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 4: Wednesday 25 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            The day of departure finally arrived. Had a good night’s sleep. Got up early and after taking leave of the family members left for Gujarat Samaj Sadan at 5.45 am from where the bus to Kathgodam was to leave. The weather was cloudy and humid. Temperature
            in late 20s. Roads were empty, although one could see an odd vehicle or two. Streetlights were glowing in daylight. A TATA 407 vehicle had overturned near the Defence Colony flyover. As we were cruising along on that road, 4-5 bulls and cows
            came charging down the road giving enormous fright to the driver. Reached the Samaj Building without any further ado.
        </p>
        <p>
            Saw that an NGO (Dharma Sanstha Samiti) was holding an elaborate farewell function to facilitate the yatris. A priest was chanting prayer and the yatris were being garlanded and given some puja samagri. A bright yellow and red polyester scarf was being
            draped around the shoulders of yatris. A beaded rosary, a pouch containing puja samagri and a bottle of mineral water were given to them. The priest also made a short speech saying that Lord Shiva is different from all gods inasmuch as when
            other gods were asked to choose their homes to settle, only He chose to settle on earth among his devotees. He also mentioned that the pouch contains “Bilvapatra” a favourite of Lord Shiva and among all the offerings made to Him, this particular
            offering can be brought back and kept in homes.
        </p>
        <p>
            When asked to say a few words, I thanked the NGO for all the trouble they took in bidding us farewell and for their kind and magnanimous words. I said we all need their blessing for completing the yatra successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            All these formalities were delaying us. I asked KMVN officials to start loading the luggage immediately so that we could leave as soon as possible. We finally left Delhi at 6.45. As soon the 53 seater a/c bus rolled out of Delhi, the yatris started singing
            Shiva’s name, slokas, bhajan and popular Shiva sangeet. A few ladies took out booklets and started reading slokas and hymns from them. At 8 we reached Ghaziabad, where we stopped at a hotel where another NGO had kept an elaborate function
            to facilitate us. Speeches were made. I thanked them for their encouraging words. One of the persons there presented me with a whistle the purpose of which I reckoned was to call all yatris should they be playing truant. I liked that. I had
            to use the whistle immediately to tell yatris that it was time to depart. They had arranged breakfast for all of us. After we had partaken of their hospitality we left the place at 9.
        </p>
        <p>
            The vehicle in which we were traveling appeared to be an old one. Although its a/c was working well, the seats could not be adjusted. If they were in slide back position they remained in that position and could not be brought to upright position. It was
            painful. The driver’s cabin was occupied by a couple of youngsters who kept him busy with incessant chat. Since the roads in UP are full of potholes and have been made narrower than they are by human encroachments and chaotic traffic, the
            ride was jerky and, of necessity, slow. The driver was adding to the jitters by talking incessantly on mobile and not caring two hoots about traffic safety.
        </p>
        <p>
            No sooner did we leave towns behind than we were treated to lush green countryside. Peasants and labourers were working on the fields. The roadsides were lined with Mahaneem, sheesham trees. The streams and rivulets were full of flowing water thanks to
            the bountiful monsoon. Egrets were busy picking up insects from host animals’ body.
        </p>
        <p>
            We had to endure the pain of traveling through the UP countryside for close to 5 hours before we crossed over to Uttarakhand. The roads thereafter became smoother. Ms. Promptly sang a few bhajans and filmi songs. She had mellifluous voice and had apparently
            taken some lessons in classical singing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amid a few yawns and general ennui, reached Kathgodam at 3 in the afternoon. The management of the KMVN guest house had made elaborate arrangement to welcome us with garlands and a glass of lemonade. The guest house is just by the side of the main narrow
            road. One actually has to step on to the road to go to the dining hall from the rooms. If you were not aware of the location of the guest house then you were likely to miss it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We finally had our lunch consisting of dal, rice, sabzi and chapati. We liked it. But little did we realize that this kind of food was going to be our staple diet for the next one month and would ultimately make yatris pine for home-cooked food.
        </p>
        <p>
            We left Kathgodam after shifting into two smaller buses. One was about 25 seater and the other 10 seater bus. Smaller buses are necessary in the hills to negotiate road curves on them. I noticed that Baggage Committee members who were supposed to supervise
            the shifting of baggage from the bigger to smaller buses were not performing their jobs properly. On way the driver allowed KMVN staff to load two small gensets in the aisle crowding it further. I was in a smaller bus with about 10 yatris
            and the remaining yatris were in a bigger bus that was driven ahead of us. The tedium of the journey was being relieved by occasional singing of bhajans and slokas. After about an hour or so we were in a sort of valley where a village called
            Kaichi Dham nestled. The driver stopped the bus in front of a temple that had been built amid sylvan surroundings. We all got down and went inside the temple to have darshan of deities. It was dusk and the light had begun to fade. Arti was
            imminent. The only thing that amazed me was the presence of a large number of foreigners in that temple who were dressed in typically Indian clothes. The ladies wearing Salwar-Kameez and gents kurta pyjamas. The temple had all the major deities
            that Hindus worship – Vaishno Devi being the most prominent there. But the major temple hosted the statue of the founder of the temple whom the foreigners worshipped. He was called Neem Karoli Baba.
        </p>
        <p>
            After spending about 20 minutes at this idyllic place, we started climbing once again and without any further ado reached Almora at 8 in the night.
        </p>
        <p>
            The KMVN guest house at Almora is situated at a height and is approachable through a narrow road. One had to climb a flight of around 30 steps to reach the reception area. Our luggage remained on the bus as we were forewarned that we would have to do
            without it at Almora. We retired to our rooms after having our dinner. I informed all the yatris that we plan to leave by 5 am in the morning, as it would take at least 12 hours to reach Dharchula. I also instructed Raju to wake everybody
            up by 4.15 am and serve them tea. For me, I gave him detailed instructions on how to prepare filter coffee that I had brought along with me for the journey.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 5: Thursday 26 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            I slept well. My room was the best in the guesthouse. Got up at 4 am; took a bath and had great filter coffee prepared by Raju. I was ready by 4.45 am and as I went down the corridor to go down to the ground floor, blew the whistle to alert yatris. The
            old couple from Maharashtra was ready and waiting in front of the guest house. The younger lot took more time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weather was sultry and not too comfortable, but outside, cool breeze blew. We left at 5.15 am after reciting Shiva Vandana. Stopped at the Mall by the side of a restaurant where one of the yatris had arranged tea and breakfast for us. This yatri was
            from Almora and wanted to fete yatris. Who could have objection to that? We were served with samosa, a piece of sweetmeat (an Almora speciality) and namkeen. After spending one hour at that place, left for Dharchula.
        </p>
        <p>
            While passing through the town could not help but notice that smaller towns are in a sense uglier than major ones. There were bent electrical poles on which garish posters hung just by a thread of a nut. The beauty of the place was marred by huge and
            out of shape billboards announcing accommodation at some resort or the other. Narrow and open drains were clogged with plastic that announced graduation to modernity. All this and more made one look with despair at the pace of progress that
            overlooked simple ways to make towns look pretty and clean.
        </p>
        <p>
            The serpentine road passed through mountainous terrain. A leopard protected area suddenly appeared and just as suddenly disappeared from view. The berm was covered with red dried pine leaves. Mountain streams were cantering along the boulder strewn slope.
            All around one could see different hues of only green colour. Terraced slopes of mountains sides indicated patchy farming by the villagers. At Beri Nag the guide who accompanied us got down to telephonically inform the KMVN at Chakori that
            we would be arriving for lunch at about 1 pm in the afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
            We arrived at Chakori at about lunchtime. The place is a little known hill station. The KMVN guest house is located inside a large compound and overlooks a very pretty valley. A row of tourist huts has been constructed to accommodate wanderers who may
            accidentally reach this place. It is a wonderful place for sure. But how many know about this town? There is a 30 feet high watchtower that allows one to look at a breathtaking view of the valley. All yatris climbed the tower to take photographs
            and videos.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the lunch, we left the place at about 2.30 pm and had barely gone about 10 kms when one of the passengers discovered that he had left behind the carry bag of a very expensive camera at Chakori near a tree. He wanted to know whether we could turn
            back and get the camera bag. It was difficult to turn back as it would have meant delay in reaching Dharchula. Nevertheless, I promised to do something about it. We got in touch with the Manager of KMVN, Chakori who had by then left for home.
            A few cell phones were working while others were not. While we were debating about what to do, we saw that a motorcyclist was washing his vehicle beside a stream that flowed by the side of the road. This was just 4 kms before Thal. We dropped
            our KMVN guide there and requested the motorcyclist to take him to Chakori and get the camera bag back. The motorcyclist as well as the guide were tipped generously by the yatri.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reached ITBP camp at Mirthi at 3pm. We were escorted by a ITBP vehicle that came to fetch us about 10 kms before the camp. Here we were to be briefed by the commandant on how to take care of ourselves during the yatra as well as the do's and don’ts.
        </p>
        <p>
            We spent about an hour at the camp and the lasting impression I have of the briefing was that it was done with clock like precision. We were served with tea and snacks at the end of the briefing. The Commandant informed us that only one batch before us
            had come back with all yatris in good health. Some of the things he said were as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Each human being is different and reacts and responds differently to the same stimuli.
            </li>
            <li>
                Be humble
            </li>
            <li>We would be trekking on the traditional route followed for ages.</li>
            <li>The yatra was closed in 1962 and reopened in 1982.</li>
            <li>Dhauliganga meets kaliganga at Tawaghat.</li>
            <li>The route would be Budhi (2740m) – 3km – Chiyyalekh (3350m) – 6km – Garbanga (3181m) – 11 kms – Gunji (3600m) – 10 kms – Kalapani (3570m) – 9kms – Nabidang – Lipulekh pass (5073m)</li>
            <li>ITBP Inmarsat nos would be:-
                <ol>
                    <li>Garbayang 00-873761105942</li>
                    <li>Gunji 00- 873761105944</li>
                    <li>Kalapani 00- 873761105940</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>A trekker gets mentally tired and not physically. Daler Mehndi danced for 2 hours after 40 kms of route march.</li>
            <li>Have positive thoughts.</li>
            <li>Avoid horse riding from Gala to Budhi.</li>
            <li>Check passport and purse physically before starting on the day’s trek.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            After tea and snacks were served we were taken for group photographs. A place had been thoughtfully selected and chairs kept there to take group photographs of yatris. We were told that on our way back each yatri would be given one copy of the photograph.
        </p>
        <p>
            We left Mirthi at 4 pm after thanking the Commandant for his hospitality. At 5 pm our bus came to a halt by the side of river close to a town called Golgatai. Just before the confluence of Kaliganga and Goriganga, a huge rock had fallen on the road. It
            was about 5 feet thick. Traffic had come to a standstill. The rock had apparently fallen at 10 am in the morning and the workers were using sledgehammers to break it down. It was a huge task. On the other side of the road was the bank of the
            river on which were built houses. So the broken pieces of rocks could not be pushed down the gorge. Nor could dynamite be used to blast off the rock. The workers finally managed to create a small space for the bus to pass at about 8 pm by
            which time darkness fell.
        </p>
        <p>
            After meandering through the hilly terrain for another hour we finally reached Dharchula at 8.45 pm in the night. The town of Dharchula is small and has very narrow roads that allow only a medium-sized bus to pass. Shops on either side of the roads make
            them dangerous for pedestrians. Stone-slabs covered the drain haphazardly. Pigs were loitering around even in the dark. The guest house is on the bank of a rapidly flowing river whose roaring sound could be heard for at least a mile.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was privileged to be accorded a VIP status and given a double-bed room when 4-5 yatris had to share a room. The luggage was unloaded and after a gap of two days. We would now be able to change our clothes.
        </p>
        <p>
            After ascertaining the requirements of yatris, I informed KMVN officials that we needed 25 ponies and 24 porters. Besides 2 cooks and 2 assistant cooks were also hired for yatra.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 6: Friday 27 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            It had rained all night. Woke up early. Switched on TV. And then switched it off. Boring. Went to the small semi-circular balcony and saw the mighty river raucously winding its way down the hill warning stragglers on its bank to stay away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coffee came. Had bath. Called porters and asked them to pack my bags. Went down and found that people had started packing bags. This at 7.30 am. The packets placed by the yatris in the foyer of the hotel were counted one by one and weighed. Then they
            were loaded onto the bus. All this took over an hour. Meanwhile a few packets were left unidentified because the yatris had played truant. After this experience I collected yatris and told them:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>To inform me whenever they go anywhere on their own.</li>
            <li>To identify their luggage whenever it is loaded on the bus.</li>
            <li>Neither increase nor decrease the number of baggages.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            After that we left for Tawaghat at 8.20 am. The way to Tawaghat winded its way along the sides of hills that surrounded the valley in which flowed the mighty Kaliganga. Numerous waterfalls sliced through the hillsides making all of us nervous. The bus
            literally passed at many places under the waterfalls and we all had to close windows to prevent water from drenching us.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we had feared our journey came to an abrupt halt after covering only 20 kms. A huge landslide had blocked the road. As I got down and started taking pictures a huge monster of a terribly noisy bulldozer came hurtling down the road. It went to the landslide
            and started clearing debris. About 50 uniformed men were already busy removing the rubble. We feared that it might take one full day to clear the amount of rubble that had blocked the road.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile a jeep from <a href="http://www.nhpcindia.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">National HydroElectric Power Corporation (NHPC)</a> came and offered us soft drinks and biscuits. When it appeared that there was no way the road could be cleared
            in an hour or two, Yatra Ahikari of KMVN informed us that we might have to cross the road on foot. So we took off our shoes, collected our personal belongings and slowly crossed the landslides on which an enormous amount of water was flowing.
            A few ladies found it difficult to cross the landslide but ultimately managed to cross with the help of guides and porters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thereafter KMVN managed to hire three jeeps on the other side of the landslide and we started moving at 10 am. We had to cover about 20 kms before our trek to Gala could begin. After about 8 km the jeep in which I was traveling developed mechanical fault.
            Its clutch wire snapped. Our driver then stopped a vehicle that was coming from opposite direction and literally forced the lone lady occupant of that vehicle to alight and make way for us. The name of the lady was Anju Devi and she was looking
            pretty in her pink salwar kameez as hill women normally do.<img class="art-img left" src="/img/pinklady.jpeg" alt="Lady in Pink" /> The vehicle was terribly crowded. The driver was sitting in a space not more than 8 inches wide.
            He was driving with only his left hand. The floor gear was nearer to me than to him and I was sitting near the window on the opposite side. It is amazing how people devise ways and means of making money without regard for passenger safety.
            Under normal circumstances I would have declined to travel in such conditions but really had no choice in the matter. He drove skillfully though and negotiated twists and turns of the hilly road with utmost dexterity.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we thought our ordeal for the day was overcame another blow. There was one more landslide before Mangti. This appeared more dangerous and risky to cross than the previous one. The rain had meanwhile intensified. The Yatra Adhikari who was with us
            made inquiries from the people and after all round consultation with villagers and drivers of jeeps told me that we have no choice but to climb the steep face of the mountain in order to skirt the landslide. This was a difficult decision to
            take. We had ladies in our group and a few were not feeling well. But taking his advice for what it was worth, we started to climb the mountain by walking on a small and insignificant footpath that appeared to be used more by horses and ponies
            than by people. We had not eaten anything since breakfast and all of us were ravenously hungry.
        </p>
        <p>
            After we had climbed for over an hour, I realized the folly of what we had done. The guides did not know the route. A few villagers who were coming from opposite direction told us that the path was risky and ladies would find it difficult to carry on.
            There were ten ladies in the group and not all of them were young. They were my biggest worry. No less worrisome were some old men in the group. It was around 4 pm and the sun was beginning to go down and I did not want to get stranded on
            the slope of the mountain. So I decided to retrace our steps after the guide also suggested that it would be unwise to carry further like this. I contacted MEA on my Satellite phone and told them that I was stranded and could neither move
            forward nor backward.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was 4 pm when we all got down to the road once again. Tempers were running high because there was no assistance in sight and nobody had anything worthwhile to eat since morning. There was no point in consulting yatris as everybody had some opinion
            or the other that others did not approve of. I was waiting for a word from Yatra Adhikuari who had disappeared from the scene after making us climb the mountain. In this situation I sent a few yatris to go forward and find out what kind of
            landslide had halted our progress. Meanwhile I went on a reconnaissance mission to find out whether the ladies in our group could find some shelter for the night. There were only two huts in the neighbourhood. One was on the face of the mountain
            that we had just climbed and the other was just below the road towards the valley. Both were utterly insufficient to accommodate the yatris. In the midst of discussion with the yatris about our next course of action came the news from the
            drivers of the jeeps that were also stranded that the road to Pangla (a village 4 kms behind us that had good possibility of lodging and boarding) was clear. The drivers suggested to us that we all should move to Pangla and spend the night
            there. I talked to the drivers and packed yatris in jeeps. As we neared the village, the jeeps came to a halt. A fresh landslide had made even that village inaccessible. Now we were truly caught between the devil and the deep sea. This landslide
            was enormous and was the result of continuous rainfall. A huge rock had fallen and a 8-10 feet high mound of rock and other debris had collected at the place where once a road existed.
        </p>
        <p>
            We all got down and surveyed the scene. Crossing it when the landslide was fresh was full of risk. Everybody was looking up to me to deliver the judgment on what was to be done next. I never felt so helpless as I did then. Nor more responsible. I had
            to take care of 30 yatris and see that they perform safe yatra. After long rumination I decided to get back to the place from where we came. So we again went back to the place where we had climbed the mountain. The logic of this decision was
            that it was preferable to have a yatri who is sick than to have someone who is a cripple. Crossing the landslide carried the risk of a serious injury while sleeping in open could only make one sick at worst.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we were mulling our options in the fast fading light, Yatra Adhikari arrived. He appeared to have been informed by Delhi that we were stuck and that he should immediately go and rescue us. He had done his homework well. He informed me that there is
            no option at that stage but to go to Pangla where he had arranged two large halls for the night’s stay. He would also arrange a good dinner for us there. He had carried blankets with him in case we decide to take his advice.
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw his point. He had also come to this place after crossing the landslide. So there was the possibility of crossing it without hurting oneself. And frankly there was also the TINA factor. Then one had also to think about how could one survive the night
            in open and attend the morning constitutionals. Keeping all this in mind I decided to take his advice and head back to the landslide from where we had just come.
        </p>
        <p>
            We arrived at the landslide at 7 pm in the evening. We took out our torches and one by one crossed the landslide without any prime or collateral damage. All of us heaved a big sigh of relief and shouted in unison “Om Namah Shivay”. The village was about
            a couple of kilometers from the landslide. In the end we made it to the village and the newly constructed halls rented out for us at about 8 pm in the night. All of us collapsed on the floor as soon as durries were spread. Tea was served and
            biscuit packets opened. Candles lit and jokes cracked. There could not have been a more apt example of how quickly tempers become pleasant in a group bound together with a common objective and with its members dependent on one another for
            support, the moment the danger facing the group disappears. An hour ago there was heated debate on what should be done. I had to remind yatris that I was in charge and my decision would have to be respected. A few yatris had glared at me and
            some were visibly upset at how things had turned out. I could not blame them. They were tired and hungry. There was no place where they could lie down and rest. They were anxious about how they would spend the night and from where would the
            next meal come. All these apprehensions were not bothering them anymore. They were lying down no matter that it was some nondescript village in a nondescript setting. All that mattered to them was the prospect of spending peaceful night with
            their bellies full. And that was what lay in store for them. And that prospect dissolved all rancour that characterized group dynamics earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dinner was arranged in a small dhaba and served to us at 10.30 pm. A person came and kept a crate of 24 empty Pepsi bottles telling us that these bottles may be used in the morning for attending to the call of nature. By 11 pm all of us retired for the
            night in a much more comfortable physical and mental state of mind than had seemed possible a few hours ago.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 7: Saturday 28 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            All of us slept well. Mostly because we were tired with the exertions of the previous day. My eyes opened at 4 am. I immediately got up and started making a lot of noise on the pretext of taking out my toiletries bag out of the rucksack in the hope that
            it would wake up yatris who were still sleeping. I brushed my teeth and made my way to the cornfield. The Yatra Adhikari was by now shouting to make everybody get up quickly. Everyone was given a cup of tea and we assembled at 5.35 am in the
            space opposite the halls. The old lady from Ahmedabad said that before we proceed we recite prayer together. So I recited “Ganapati Atharvashirsha”. After loud chanting of Om Namah Shivay /Har Har Mahadev we started our trek, in the faint
            pre-dawn daylight. It started drizzling. Everyone was wearing a raincoat. My poncho that I had specifically got made was serving me well.
        </p>
        <p>
            We eventually came to the place of landslide. All of us were now mentally better prepared to deal with it. As I was crossing it I saw one of the yatri climbing on the rock that had fallen in the middle of that dangerous slide and filming the crossing
            of the yatris on his handycam. I shouted at him and asked him to immediately get down and cross over to the safety of the other side. I also warned him that should I find him doing such stupid things in future I would not hesitate to leave
            him behind. The man did not realize that he was putting his and others’ lives at risk by doing so. The best way to cross a landslide is to cross it quickly and be done with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The head section of the group had by then reached the second landslide that had delayed us the previous day. When we left Dharchula we were joined by a doctor from Uttarakhand Health Service, Dr. HS Yanki, who had been deployed by the government to look
            after the health of the yatris till Gunji. Two policemen with wireless sets also joined us. They were assigned roles as head and tail of the group during our trek.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the head policeman of the group sent the message that he needed my permission to allow yatris to cross the landslide, I gave my tail policeman the permission to wire my approval. For one thing we were mentally prepared to carry on regardless. And
            for another, I did not look at the possibility of spending another day and night in the middle of nowhere with any pleasant anticipation. It was only when I reached the landslide later that I realized what I had done. The landslide that had
            detained us so far had formed as a result of a section of hill falling down the valley and taking down the road with it. The rubble did not comprise rocks but loose soil. The road had as usual disappeared and the three little mounds of loose
            soil, of about 8-10 feet height, had formed at a place where there once was a motorable road with steep sloping surface. These mounds were separated from each other by 5-10 feet of walkable road. Below these mounds was a steep valley about
            100 feet deep at the bottom of which flowed the Kali. It was making a terrific sound flowing hard as it was on huge rocky boulders throwing up sprays of fine and misty water droplets several feet high.
        </p>
        <p>
            It became clear to me that if the group were to cross the landslide on foot it would need the helping hand of providence and a huge slice of luck. For if any yatri were to slip while crossing those mounds of loose and wet soil, he would just freely roll
            down the slope to eventually fall 100 feet in the river that would swallow him in no time without leaving any trace behind.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few yatris were, and I must admit I too was, scared while crossing the landslide. A false step and the fast flowing river would willingly have embraced one. Eventually we crossed without any mishap. It is at times like this that one begins to believe
            in someone up there directing the affairs of those who inhabit this planet. Call him by any name you wish: Ram, Rahim, Jesus... but his all-powerful presence cannot be described in words. It has to be felt. Otherwise why should it be that
            some people fall or slip and some others do not slip at all while crossing the same river or a mountain pass?
        </p>
        <p>
            Before I started to climb the mound I enquired from the yatra adhikari whether it is safer to allow the yatris to cross the dangerous and potentially risky landslide. He laid my fears to rest by saying that many villagers have crossed the landslide in
            the night and early morning making the path harder and firmer than what it was the previous day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suitably reassured I started to climb. Before me was a lady of 60 from Bangalore who was a little on the plumb side. She was finding it difficult to get a firm foothold on the loose soil and pebbles that comprised the landslide. She would bend, sit on
            her hips and then place her foot on the ground before moving her body forward using hands as a prop. That naturally took time. Behind me were two ladies who were younger and fitter. One of them was a native of Uttarakhand and was perhaps aware
            and knowledgeable about how to cross the landslide. Both these ladies wanted the group to cross the landslide as quickly as possible. But the plump lady was slowing the entire group. Eventually the group managed to cross without any further
            ado and everybody heaved a big sigh of relief. Lord Shiva certainly seemed to be with us. The woman yatri from the UK told me that the best way to cross any landslide is to cross as quickly as possible to prevent injuries from falling debris
            that might still be waiting for the slightest nudge or a movement to fall.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was our first acid test of our ability to hold together as a group in face of adversity. And I must admit that my handling of the crisis left a lot to be desired. It was probably just as well that the difficulties were encountered in the beginning
            of the yatra. They made us a lot more realistic about what to expect in the days to come.
        </p>
        <p>
            By now the rains had grown in intensity. We quickly crossed a small bridge that lay a little ahead of us beyond which was an ITBP camp. The ITBP men welcomed us with tea and some biscuits. The horses and ponies for the yatris were a little further ahead
            from where those who wanted to ride the ponies could mount them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those who had not asked either for pony or porter started their trek without further loss of time. I had my porter-cum-cook with me. He carried one rucksack while I carried another with me. We were all suitably dressed to protect ourselves from the rain
            that showed no sign of abating. The landscape seemed full of water. Huge mountains on either side of the valley supported scores of waterfalls both big and small. On several occasions during this part of the trek we had to pass under waterfalls
            that drained huge amount of water over overhanging rocks. The path at many places had been badly wounded by the sheer force of water that fell on it. The sky looked gray and dull. It did not seem as it was going to open up in a hurry. The
            river seemed to grow bigger and bigger as it collected an enormous amount of water from these streams and waterfalls. On the black faces of rocks were painted messages that exhorted the trekkers to be wary and careful. The weather though not
            exactly cold was not pleasant either. And those who were walking briskly were sweating.
        </p>
        <p>
            After walking for about a couple of hours we came to a place called Lakhanpur where we had our breakfast. The place consisted of no more than a couple of dhabas. The dhaba in which we sat had low ceiling and stone slabs were kept on three sides that were
            covered with blankets for yatris to sit. This was a pattern that we saw at most of these eating-joints. They had made comfortable but basic arrangements for yatris to sit and rest. Upon arrival they were served with aloo ki sabzi, green chutney
            and puris. Puris looked soaked in oil and made our fingers sticky. But it tasted fine. After resting for about 20 minutes we all moved ahead. Actually we were not moving as a group. Those who could manage to walk fast were ahead of others.
            I was alone with my porter and kept changing my position in the group to ensure that everybody was fine. The doctor was with the tail section of our group so that in case any help was needed he could easily be contacted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next stop was a place called Malpa where a terrible tragedy took place in the year 1998. Malpa is about 5 kms from Lakhanpur. Walking at a normal pace the distance could be covered in 2-3 hours. Those of us who enjoyed walking in mountains were now
            beginning to forget the inconveniences of the last few days and keenly soaking in the atmosphere. The rainy season had painted the landscape in various hues of green and wherever the green colour appeared to be interrupted, it occurred mainly
            because of landslides that brought down a portion of the hill along with it. There was that grayish mistiness to the air with rain lashing down with great force. The path though held firm. The railings that had been constructed at tricky bends
            had been twisted. It appeared that ponies that carried pilgrims’ luggage for the last so many years had savagely assaulted these metallic railings. The path was narrow and fully loaded ponies were bound to collide with railing while negotiating
            the twists and turns of the mountain trail. The rocks under which we passed had become wet and oozed water. Moss had formed on them. The pebbles and rocks that we had to step on had become slippery. So walking was of necessity slow and arduous.
            Even those pilgrims who rode on ponies had to get down and walk through certain portions of the path, as the overhanging rocks under which one had to pass did not provide sufficient space for the pony with the pilgrim riding on it to pass
            unhindered. Even though I had not hired a pony I had to bend to avoid bumping my head against the rocks. Once or twice my vigil slackened and my head hit the rock. Luckily I wasn’t walking fast.
        </p>
        <p>
            Malpa has become synonymous with tragedy in mountain. In the year 1998, the pilgrims of 12th batch met with their watery grave when a cloudburst suddenly brought about the collapse of a portion of a mountain. The pilgrims who were sleeping in tents close
            to the river did not get any chance to flee to safety. Only a few survived this terrible tragedy. A large number of porters, ponies and pilgrims perished in that summer. So it was with some amount of trepidation that the yatris of my batch
            were walking towards the site of that tragedy.
        </p>
        <p>
            We reached Mangti at about lunchtime. The approach to Mangti is through a flat open space on both sides of the path. The place where tragedy struck the pilgrims does not have any tell-tale signs of that accident. Huge undergrowth of dense vegetation had
            hidden any scars of that terrible tragedy that might have survived. The portion of the mountain that collapsed does bear some resemblance to the wounded giant. But it too appeared to be healing well with bits of vegetation appearing on its
            slope. As they say time is a great healer.
        </p>
        <p>
            We entered the dhaba in which a small boy of about 12 welcomed me with a huge home grown geranium red flower. A small garden behind the eatery tended well by the owner provided these flowers. I was touched. In the middle of nowhere one can still find
            people who can genuinely make their guests happy. The lunch consisted of puris and potato vegetable with curry. We ate our lunch, rested for a few minutes and thanked the owner and his waiter-boy profusely for their wonderful hospitality.
            The place was bare and those who lived in that village would be living a life of privation, as we city-dwellers would call it. But all we could see on their faces were smiles of contentment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rain had subsided a bit by now. We were now slowed down by exhaustion. The path appeared to be endless. The village of Lamiri was the next stop 4 kms later. The jawans of Seema Suraksha Bal (SSB) received us at Lamiri. I was escorted to an FRB hut
            where I was given tea and snacks. These jawans of SSB guard our frontier with Nepal that lies on the other side of the river Kali. They also live a life of isolation with no connectivity to their hometowns and villages. They spend a couple
            of years in these difficult, yet beautiful parts of the country, before they become eligible to be posted to better areas. The SSB camp consisted of a few FRB huts and was close to the Kali river.
        </p>
        <p>
            However before we reached Lamiri we had to negotiate a mountain stream that had washed away a temporary bridge. A huge stream about 20 feet wide bumped over huge rocks before falling over a gradually sloping hills to meet Kali. Since it was not possible
            to cross the river without assistance, jawans of SSB had been busy placing heavy rocks on the shallow bed of the stream to make it passable. Later, on our way back we saw that a temporary bridge had been constructed to enable the yatris to
            cross the river without assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
            From Lamari Budhi is 5 kms. The physical exertion of having walked 22 kms since leaving Pangla, was now slowly beginning to tell on everyone. I kept a steady and slow pace of 2 km an hour and eventually got near the Budhi camp. A kilometer before the
            camp, 2 ITBP constables were waiting for me with a cup of tea and a plate of cashew nuts near a bend in the hill. Liaison Officer in this yatra is a privileged person and gets preferential treatment. After a rest of 5 minutes, we continued
            on our trek. By 5 pm we were in Budhi camp.
        </p>
        <p>
            This trek is by far the most enjoyable as also the most difficult. It passes through rugged and most difficult mountain terrain full of ups and downs. One minute you are ascending and the next, descending. This kind of trek saps one’s energy. Drinking
            water and eating high calorie nuts and chocolates is extremely essential. The rains also made this trek difficult as well as enjoyable. Difficult because one has to walk through slush, mud, slippery rocks and waterfalls that drop tons of water
            on one’s body. Enjoyable because it is rare that one gets an opportunity to trek in monsoon in these beautiful hills with all the resources of the state ready to lend a helping hand whenever required.
        </p>
        <img class="art-img-large middle" src="/img/campbudhi.png" alt="Camp at Budhi" />
        <p>
            Budhi camp consisted of 4-5 semicircular FRB huts each of which could accommodate around 8-10 yatris. The LO is lodged in a Public Works Department (PWD) guest house. The accommodation is basic but comfortable. One Govind Singh who was a Group IV employee
            of PWD looked after me. As soon as I collapsed on the chair in the verandah of the guest house, he gave me a cup of tea and biscuits. Then he enquired whether I would need a bucket of hot water to immerse my legs in it. I was unaware of this
            treatment. I was told that if after a particularly strenuous trek, a trekker were to dip his legs up to knee level in a bucket full of warm water mixed with salt, he would feel enormously good and the pain, if any, in the legs would disappear.
            I was grateful for the suggestion. I asked him to get me warm water in a bucket. He said that it would be advisable to do it before going to bed at night. Shortly thereafter it was dark and Govind Singh came with a solar lamp and a few candles
            to light the room. The solar lamp malfunctioned. I asked Govind Singh why did he bring the solar lamp if he knew that the lamp malfunctioned. He had no answer. I gave him proper instructions on how to make filter coffee in the morning. After
            sometime he brought soup made from ready-made soup powder and asked whether I would come to dinner in the dining hall. Since I was too tired to go out, I requested him to bring dinner in my room. He did so dutifully.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sun had by now set and it was beginning to get a little chilly. Our luggage that was being carried by the ponies had not arrived. All our woolens were in them. The local KMVN official informed me that the luggage has so far reached Malpa and it would
            be delivered the next day. I told one of the yatris in charge of luggage to inform all the yatris about the position and also to inform that we shall all depart the next day at 6 in the morning. Later on I was informed that the luggage had
            arrived at 9 by which time the yatris were too tired to bother. After sometime, I called it a day.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 8: Sunday 29 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            We all got up at 4 am in the morning. We were given tea and after sometime milk with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournvita" target="_blank">Bournvita.</a> I took bath with hot water supplied by Govind Singh.
        </p>
        <p>
            After reciting our customary morning prayer in the courtyard in front of my room we all began our trek to Gunji. My porter who carried my rucksack containing water and other small eats accompanied me. It was dark when we began. After walking for a kilometer,
            the steep climb to the mountain pass of Chialekh began. It was indeed a steep climb. In a space of 3 kms one climbs about 600 meters.
        </p>
        <p>
            I kept on walking at a steady pace of 1.5 kms an hour. Also took frequent breaks to catch breath. The climb was steep and during some portion even those yatris who had ridden on ponies had to get down and walk. By the time we reached the top of the mountain
            at 8.15 all of us were exhausted. The entrance to the valley of Chialekh is through a small opening in a huge rock and once you pass through that opening – which incidentally is decorated with prayer flags and bunting – you are almost at level
            and thereafter one almost walks for about 10 km on plain level. The next 10 kms or so is through the most beautiful valley of the entire yatra. The valley is about 2 kms wide and 10 kms long and is surrounded by mountains that have streams
            flowing through their sides. The depth of the valley is about 300 meters. The vegetation also changes and now one sees pine and deodar trees. Wild flowers abound in all colours. It is the most enjoyable to trek in such heavenly surroundings.
            The weather was sunny and there was pleasant nip in the air. Flowers were in bloom. Himalayan Griffons soared over the valley and its back was visible to us. We were reminded of the famous song “Suhana safar aur ye mausam hansi” from the film
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhumati" target="_blank">“Madhumati”</a>.<br>

            us were green and turquoise in colour and tufts of cloud floated over their summit tops.
        </p>
        <img class="art-img left" src="/img/budhiganjitrek.jpeg" alt="Trekking between Budhi and Gunji" />
        <p>
            At Chialekh we had breakfast of puri and chole in a dhaba next to the SSB chowki. The SSB men had made a makeshift Mandir where I prayed and then carried on with my trek. This place is also restricted and no one is allowed to go beyond without any permit.
            Our passports were checked and we were made to sign a register kept by the SSB men. A couple of ITBP policemen accompanied me right through the trek from this place onwards.
        </p>
        <p>
            After walking for about 6 kms through this heavenly valley I reached Garbayang village at 11 am. Entered a tea stall where porters and villagers were enjoying their time and food. I ordered noodles. It was okay. Meanwhile I saw yatris coming from Gunji
            and going towards Budhi. Was informed that they were from 8th batch returning after completing the yatra. I wanted to speak to the LO of the batch and get his first hand account of the yatra and any important tips that he may have to give
            me.
        </p>
        <p>
            After about 20 minutes came the LO, one Mr. Dilip Sinha from MEA. He looked haggard and sported several days’ of stubble on his chin. He told me that LO must hire a pony even if he is fit enough to walk, just in case he might feel the need for it. He
            said that LO has to be in good health, not because he has to lead the yatris till the end, but also because he owes it to himself to be in good health. He was found to be having high BP in Gunji and wanted to play safe by engaging a pony for
            himself. And since the government foots the bill of LO, it is incumbent upon LO to hire a pony.
        </p>
        <p>
            His advice was faultless. I decided that I shall engage a pony from Gunji till Lipulekh and told my porter to find a good pony at Gunji.
        </p>
        <p>
            Took 2 hours from Garbayang to reach Siti village. My porter was from Garbayang and he informed me that a row of houses at a slightly higher elevation have been sinking for the last several years. Their owners have abandoned them for fear of some tragedy
            striking them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Had lunch in the dhaba by the roadside. It consisted of potatoes, green vegetables, dal and roti. Left after a brief rest and reached Gunji at 5 pm by covering a distance of 6 kms. On way to Gunji saw a water-powered flour-mill. It was maintained by a
            villager and was continuously grinding coarse grain. The water gushed from a man-made channel that struck the wooden fins/blades fixed on a vertical spindle. The spindle was attached to two grinding stones that rotated by the force of water
            striking the blades. It was environment-friendly way of meeting the needs of villagers. Those who get the grains ground in the flourmill left a portion of the flour for the use of individual who maintained it. There were two flourmills in
            series. The water that flowed from one mill entered the other mill that was at a slightly lower height and rotated the grinding stones. I took a video of this mill to show to children back home.

        </p>
        <p>
            Thereafter one had to cross a bridge to enter the village of Gunji. We were welcomed by ITBP men who gave us tea and biscuits as usual. As soon as these formalities were over we started walking again. The KMVN camp was about 2 km from the village. The
            setting of the village was wonderful and attractive. The village was bounded on one side by mountains and on the other side by fields that precipitously sloped down to the bank of the river about 50 feet below. Both the men and women worked
            hard to make ends meet. The wooden doors of the houses were decorated in traditional motifs and were carved in simple yet elegant design. We passed through these houses on our way to the camp.
        </p>
        <p>
            We soon reached the camp where again I was put up in a room away from the huts that were assembled for the yatris. I had a largish room with three cots. Attached to it was a bathroom and toilet. There was huge vacant space in front of my room and one
            had to cross a low wall to get to the camp that was about 100 feet away. A little shelter had been erected for the horses and ponies to rest and eat. The vacant space was used by the pony wallahs to unload the cargo they carried.
        </p>
        <p>
            After we had refreshed ourselves, I checked my luggage that had meanwhile arrived. The condition of the bags that had been kept in the so-called waterproof fertilizer bags suggested that the bags had been badly handled. The incessant rains had made their
            condition even worse.
        </p>
        <p>
            I found that one tetra pack of orange juice had burst and the juice had leaked out. Clothes were not only wet and stained but also now smelt of juice. One packet containing laddus had also broken and the material had stained a few woolens. I had to immediately
            spread out these clothes to get them to dry. Strings were hastily drawn between two available points and clothes hung. Fortunately the weather was sunny and we had a breather the next day. That allowed us to reorganize ourselves. By the time
            I finished drying my clothes on strings outside the weather had become chilly. I took out my woolens and wore the windcheater that I had bought on the eve of this yatra.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next day was going to be devoted to medical examination of yatris and rest. All the yatris went to a temple for evening bhajans. The ITBP men had at all camps constructed temples where they congregated in the evenings and sang bhajans. A few men seemed
            to have developed admirable proficiency in playing dholaks and other musical instruments that are used in singing bhajans. I attended that evening’s session and enjoyed it immensely. In these areas these men had little to do in the evenings
            and they pass their time by either playing outdoor games or singing bhajans in temples. This session lasted for one hour after which went to our camp.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a room next to mine in which a contractor was staying. I heard a radio cackling in his room. He was listening to the commentary of India-England test match that was going on and in which India seemed to be having an upper hand. We listened to
            the commentary together after which we had a most forgettable dinner and went off to sleep.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 9: Monday 30 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            Got up in the morning a little early. It appeared to have rained a little but after sometime sun peeped through the clouds. That prompted me to tie up another string to dry up all clothes. Even those that were dry. The man serving me offered to wash dirty
            clothes. I paid him Rs. 50/- for the service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Had breakfast and went to the medical briefing by Captain Ratra of ITBP. The captain was from Assam and had specifically been deputed to Gunji for this purpose. I saw him scolding a few yatres for being late for the briefing. When I entered the briefing
            hall at 8.30 am only 10-12 yatris were present. More started trooping in during the next few minutes. The good young doctor explained what lack of oxygen can do to body at high altitudes and what precautions should be taken.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the medical check up was to begin, I went to Dr. Ratra and confessed that I forgot my medical report. He agreed to check me up on the condition that I give in writing that I am okay and if anything happens to me I shall be solely responsible. I did
            not understand the logic of this condition as the MEA has already taken an indemnity bonds from all of us to that effect. Surprisingly my BP showed 170/100 and my oxygen content in blood 84%. That was a tad low. He asked me to come again for
            a check up in the afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I was arranging my luggage for the next day’s journey, an ITBP man came and handed over an invitation from the commanding officer for lunch in ITBP officers’ mess. There Dr. Ratra and his colleagues were present. The lunch, though simple, was served
            in officers’ dining hall with all pomp and show that is normally associated with uniformed service. It consisted of dal, chawal, subzi and salad. It might appear very simple food but in those areas where everything is to be brought up the
            hills on ponies and by porters it is a luxury and one comes to appreciate such gestures.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the afternoon I went for my check up. My BP was 160/100. The doctor gave me Alprazolam 0.25 mg and asked me to take it at bedtime. The doctor also gave me a list of 5 yatris who needed to be particularly looked after, as they too were hypertensive.
            One patient of high BP was a young man of 32. In the evening Ramesh, my porter, came and helped me to pack my bags for next day’s journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the evening went to the Mandir for Bhajan along with other yatris. Came back by 8 pm. Had light dinner and slept. The weather on both days was clear and sunny.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 10: Tuesday 31 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            Got up in the morning, had coffee, shaved for the first time since I left Delhi, and took hot water bath. Went to the doctor for further check up. My BP was 142/82. The tablet appeared to have done the trick. The doctor announced my BP with visible relief
            and happiness. I too was happy that my BP had come back to normal. The other yatris who also went for check up had high BP.
        </p>
        <p>
            Breakfast consisted of porridge and milk with Bournvita. It was good and everybody enjoyed it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We all assembled at the courtyard in front of Mandir after praying to Lord Shiva. I said Ganapati stotra. Everybody was happy to walk again after a day’s break. The next stop was going to be Kalapani, about 9 kms from Gunji.
        </p>
        <p>
            This trek was most beautiful. The weather was sunny and balmy. The path is almost at level with the river Kali. Pine and deodar trees lined both sides of the footpath. Thorny shrubs with berry-like fruits were in abundance. Porter plucked them and ate
            them. I also tasted these berries and found them to be astringent and lemony.
        </p>
        <p>
            After 3 hours of trek reached Kalapani. The entry to the camp is through a Kali Mandir. The entrance to the precincts of Mandir was festooned with hundreds of small brass bells attached to strings on either side of the path. It is believed that River
            Kali originates from the spot where the idol of Goddess Kali has been consecrated. The KMVN camp is in a narrow valley. LO’s room was a pucca structure while the yatris were accommodated in FRB huts.
        </p>
        <img class="art-img-large middle" src="/img/ommountain.jpeg" alt="Om Parvat at Nabhi Dang partly hidden by clouds" />
        <p>
            Went around for a little birding in the evening. Saw horned lark, white naped water redstart, large-billed crows and yellow-billed chough. In Gunji I had hired a horse just in case I needed it. The owner of the horse was a young man who had a lovely black
            dog. The dog was enjoying the ride and gamboling around us. It occasionally would go very far from us and one whistle from its owner was enough to bring it back. From time to time it searched the bushes for any morsel of food. It was a fine
            dog and I fell in love with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the western side of the camp stood Sheshnag parvat. The peaks of the mountains looked exactly like the raised hood of multi-headed snake. I took its pictures. A little ahead of the camp was Sage Vyasa’s cave where he is believed to have performed penance.
            The cave becomes visible on route to Nabidang and it is an opening of about 10-15 feet about 700 feet above the ground. The face of the rock in which the opening is seen is vertical and only an experienced mountaineer can get inside the cave.
            We were informed that a few ITBP men had gone there and hoisted Indian Tricolour at its entrance. We could see the Tricolour on our way to Nabhidang.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the evening fell, chilly winds began to blow across the valley. We covered ourselves in woolens and went to the temple for singing bhajans. At this point I must record my observations about the yatris from South. They seem reluctant to wear woolens
            clothes. Only when it becomes really cold do they take out woolens and wear them. I saw them roaming about in dhoti half-turned up in a typical Tamil style. One gentleman, whom I got to know well later, wore only half-sleeved shirt throughout
            the yatra – even in China. I do not know whether they did not feel cold or they did not want to wear woolens. As a matter of fact I tried many a time to tell them not to take any chances with their health. But my pleas fell on deaf ears.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Bhajan session in the evening was joyous and enjoyable. I began to like the way bhajans are sung and all these bhajans have the theme of yatra and how one undergoes many sufferings and privations to reach Lord Shiva’s abode in Kailash Parvat.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the time we came back from the temple, it was pretty dark and quite cold. We then had our dinner and retired to our rooms. At all these places the rooms have only one 40 W bulb that lights up the room at night. Even this is because of a gen set run
            on diesel. So everybody has to pack up by 10 at night because the genset is switched off at that time. Candles are there of course but one cannot totally depend on candles. And then mobiles batteries need to be recharged.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 11: Wednesday 1 August 2007</h3>
        <p>
            It had rained at night. Got up as usual at 5 am. Slept well probably because of the tablet given by the doctor. Went to the doctor at 7 for check up. The rain had slowed down to a drizzle. BP was 160/100. Requested the doctor who was in MI room to come
            and check up other BP patients. All of them had high BP. The young man had 159/110. I forced him to hire a pony and told him not to get down from it till we reached Nabidang.
        </p>
        <p>
            We started after we had our breakfast at 9 am. I walked for about an hour till all the yatris had overtaken me. I was last and was walking one-step-one-breath at a time. As the climb became steeper, the exertion began to tell. I then decided to sit on
            pony for the first time. I remembered the words of Dr. Ratra who had said while briefing the yatris, “why to exert when your horse can do that for you”. The track was not bad but the effect of less oxygen was beginning to tell on those who
            were still walking. There were a few yatris who walked very well and did not in the least feel uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I may have ridden for barely half an hour when I saw a group of ITBP men and a few yatris huddled together and comforting Nitya or Ms. Prompty. It so happened that one of the Army personnel carrying a huge trunk coming from opposite directions had struck
            the pony in the rib accidentally. The pony got scared and the yatri fell down. She appeared to be more in shock than in pain. There were no visible marks of external injury. While she was crying on the shoulders of ITBP men some yatris gave
            her analgesic tablets. After a while she began to walk though a little slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The vegetation along the route had now thinned considerably. But flowers in myriad colours were still wonderfully holding out. There were patches of these small lovely flowers here and there that made trekking and riding a horse a pleasant experience.
            The tiny flowers that seemed to grow out of the ground appeared to have no stem. Even the plant and leaves were too tiny to be visible. My horse and dog that followed us, kept company. The dog’s name was “Khomcho”. It was a good mountain dog
            and I took its photo.
        </p>
        <img class="art-img left" src="/img/khomcho.jpeg" alt="Khomcho and my guide" />
        <p>
            Meanwhile the batteries of the camera gave way. I did not have spare batteries. I therefore could not take any photographs of this part of the route. The rest of the journey was uneventful and we reached a huge valley in which were KMVN and ITBP camps.
            As soon as we arrived we were given a glass of orange juice. The weather was sunny.
        </p>
        <p>
            The camp itself consisted of 5-6 FRB huts (semicircular) each of which was large enough to accommodate 10 yatris. I was given a separate green coloured tent that had two mattresses. The tent was of 8’X10’ size and cozy. A chair could be placed inside
            comfortably.
        </p>
        <p>
            The camp at Nabhidang was situated in a huge broad valley. Om Parvat was to the east and was at that time covered with clouds. The place was decidedly chilly even in the afternoon. All the yatris took out their cameras and handycams and started photographing
            the beautiful valley. You could see snow covered mountain peaks. During the brief moment when the clouds cleared and Om as written in Devnagari script was clearly visible, I took its photograph.
        </p>
        <p>
            We took lunch at 12.30 pm which consisted of Dal, subzi, roti and rice. The quality of rice was good. I slept in the afternoon after lunch with 2 thick quilts and dreamt of some journey the details of which I could not recall after I woke up. But I had
            a sound sleep. I felt that I had developed fever. But fortunately that was not true. I was woken up by assistant cook with a cup of tea and plate full of biscuits (Good Day and Monaco). By that time my porter Ramesh had come and assisted me
            in packing for the next day. I decided to leave behind some clothes in Nabhidang that I felt would not be required in China.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thereafter soup was served while I was writing this diary at 6 pm. I rang up home from the satellite phone available with KMVN. The cost was Rs. 68/- for 2 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I told the yatris that those who wished to walk the next day to Lipulekh pass would have to start early at 3.45 am and those who wished to ride pony could start a little later at 4.30. That was because walking at that height takes a lot more time
            and one needs to rest more frequently. They were also informed that KMVN would serve tea at 3.30 am and breakfast consisting of cornflakes/milk would be served at 4 am.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weather had become quite cold at 6 pm in the evening. But surprisingly a few South Indian yatris were sporting only one layer of clothes as opposed to five layers of woolens that I wore. I cautioned them to be careful.
        </p>
        <img class="art-img left" src="/img/campsite.jpeg" alt="Campsite in Nabhidang with Mandir in the background" />
        <p>
            There are four huts in this camp for yatris. One hut is for KMVN office and one more is used as a storeroom. Every year 4 primitive types of toilets (much more modern than those we found in China) are constructed as the ones that are constructed are destroyed
            under tons of snow that envelops the valley in winters. The generator is cranked to life at 7 pm in the evening to supply electricity to huts. One bulb only. It also charges batteries for satellite phone kept in KMVN office. The valley looks
            like a big two terraced structure with KMVN camp at higher level and the ITBP camp at a lower level. By 7 pm the entire valley was covered in clouds. The temperature began to drop appreciably and might have reached sub-zero level during the
            night. Several layers of clothing were required to keep one warm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visited the Mandir that was about 200 meters north of the camp on route to Lipulekh and at a slightly higher level. It had been constructed by one of the survivors of a chopper crash in 93. The wreckage of the crash can still be seen near the Mandir as
            a testimony of the power of nature over man and machine.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I was writing this diary, a paramedic came and checked my BP. It was 136/90. That only shows that the body takes time to acclimatize. The BP was taken for the first time in supine position.
        </p>
        <p>
            The generator set was switched on at 7 pm. There was a bulb in each tent. Dinner was served at 7.30 and consisted of Dal, aloo sabzi, rice and roti. It must be said to the credit of KMVN that they had managed to give a sweet dish at every meal. As I write
            this it is 8 pm in the night and I must go to bed to be able to get up in the morning at 3.30
        </p>
        <h3>Day 12: Thursday 2 August 2007</h3>
        <p>
            It appeared to have rained at night. It is quite common in the hills to have a completely cloudless sky throughout the night and then to have a cloudy morning. The caretaker had switched on the generator set at 3 am in the morning to wake us up. I had
            slept soundly. I was woken up by the waiter who brought a cup of tea to my tent.
        </p>
        <p>
            After sometime we all ate our breakfast of porridge and bournvita milk (much diluted). After saying our customary prayers in the morning, I started to walk at 4 am. It was cold and I was fully prepared with multi-layered clothing to cross Lipulekh pass
            at 7.45 am. For that was the time the Chinese had decided to come to the pass for exchange of yatris. The 8th batch was coming back to India and my batch would be entering China.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although it was cold the absence of chilly winds made the cold bearable. After walking for sometime I decided to ride the pony. It is difficult to walk at that altitude (16000 feet). Pronounced lack of oxygen makes breathing difficult. All yatris reached
            Lipulekh at about 7.45 am by which time the light had improved considerably. We were accompanied by about 15-20 jawans of ITBP who were making sure that we were well and not showing any signs of altitude sickness and fatigue.
        </p>
        <img class="art-img-large middle" src="/img/ridelipulekh.jpeg" alt="Riding to Lipulekh pass" />
        <p>
            Once we reached the Lipulekh pass we had nothing to do but to wait for the word from Chinese side. While we waited for the news to come, ITBP men constantly reminded us to keep our hands and feet moving to keep blood circulation going. Toes and fingers
            were to be exercised by constant movement. Facial muscles were to be kept taut by blowing air in the mouth while keeping it shut.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lipulekh pass is a tiny little pass at about 16500 feet that is normally covered in snow. There is little vegetation on the hills that surround it. Little tufts of grass are occasionally seen here and there. Even flowers. But the area is desolate and
            made even more so by its inaccessibility. Mountains though are wonderful and host a number of streams that flow from them. Stones and huge boulders litter the path through which we passed. By the time we reached the pass I could notice that
            yatris were exhausted not so much by exertion but from lack of oxygen. Surprisingly ITBP men seemed not to be affected either by the climate or by the lack of oxygen. Yatris had tied bands containing camphor on their wrists or had tied them
            round their necks. The smell of camphor is believed to assist in breathing.
        </p>
        <img class="art-img left" src="/img/lipulekh.jpeg" alt="Chinese side of Lipulekh Pass" />
        <p>
            Finally after waiting for half an hour the message arrived from the Chinese side that yatris of 8th batch had arrived at the pass from Chinese side. We were now advised to move forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            I suddenly saw horses coming to the pass from Chinese side on which were riding yatris. There were greeting followed by “OM NAMAH SHIVAY”. We all moved forward. Yatris were advised to tell porters and pony wallahs whether they were supposed to report
            on 14 August when we would be crossing the pass on our way back. If the porters were not told in advance they would not take the trouble of coming all the way to Lipulekh.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next 2 hours after crossing were horrible. When I crossed the pass I was introduced to our guide one Mr. Guru. He was a Tibetan-young and energetic. He was in early thirties and had studied in Hubli where there is a Tibetan settlement. He knew Kannadiga
            language well besides Hindi and English. He was short, fair and sported the loosely hanging short and sparsely grown beard that is the hallmark of traditional Chinese men. He appeared to be as canny and cunning as a fox. The incoming LO was
            one Dr. Singh from ITBP who appeared to have been shaken by the death of a yatri from his batch after Dolma pass. Since he was ably assisted by Mr. Guru during those trying times, he told me that Guru was a great guide and we must follow his
            advice. Guru apparently had advised Singh to suggest to me that all yatris must hire pony and porters for Kailash Parikrama, even though many thought of doing the parikrama on foot. The reason why Guru advised Singh to tell me this became
            clear later.
        </p>
        <p>
            Guru then asked me to take all yatris to a huge black boulder that stood down the path about 2 kms from the pass. The sun had come out now and it was sunny as well as chilly. The chill and the lack of oxygen had made me very uncomfortable. I do not recall
            much of that time except that I kept on walking painfully, tiredly down the road in search of that elusive black rock. It was not 2 kms down but almost 5 kms and all yatris were completely exhausted by the time they reached that boulder. A
            few fitter yatris walked further down to the place from where the bus was to depart.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the time I reached the black boulder, I was completely exhausted. How much was it due to tiredness; how much it was due to lack of oxygen, I cannot tell. But no sooner had I reached the rock than I showed typical signs of mountain sickness or lack
            of oxygen. I had a headache and had a feeling that I wanted to throw up. Nausea appeared to be building up. But no sooner had I that feeling come than I recovered. How I cannot tell. I only remember that I was not able to answer even the casual
            and routine queries of yatris. One couple that walked down much after I reached the rock wanted to know how far is the bus. I just did not feel like answering them and waved them on to move on suggesting that it was close by.
        </p>
        <p>
            Irritability is another sign of this sickness and I was becoming irritable when other yatris tried to talk to me. I just wanted to be left alone to sort out my health problems. I think this was the worst crisis I faced in my entire yatra. But the good
            part of it was that it did not last long and I recovered pretty quickly. But so long as it lasted it was difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            We might have perhaps stayed at the rock for close to one hour. Then we saw horses coming down from the pass. It appears that the owners of the Chinese horses settle down to eat breakfast after dropping yatris at the pass. This delays their departure
            to pick up yatris because of which the yatris have to perforce wait.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not a satisfactory state of affairs and I made a mental note of mentioning this in my report. Presently I was helped to get on a horse by the owner who handed me the rein and asked me handle the horse. This is not the way the Indian horse owners
            handle the yatris. They walk alongside the horse and help the yatris in whichever way they can.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chinese authorities’ treatment of yatris is so rude and indifferent in comparison to the kind of treatment that they get in India from Indian authorities that yatris find it difficult to adjust to the way Chinese do things in their own country. The first
            shock of this treatment came in the form of how the horse owners left the yatris to deal with horses. Language barrier though is a major irritation and comes in the way of meaningful communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we had 4 cooks with us – of which one was also acting as my porter – I did not have to carry my rucksack that other yatris had to carry on their own backs. When all the yatris reached the bus parked about 6 kms from the pass, I just plonked myself
            down on the front seat and instantly dozed off.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got up after about half an hour or so. The bus was being driven through vast plain countryside surrounded by snow-capped mountains. There was little evidence of vegetation or trees. Whatever green patches could be seen were fields sown with wheat, mustard
            and peas in perfect rectangular patches. Otherwise the entire countryside was barren and brownish gray in colour. Even the fields that relieved the monotony were irrigated by mountain stream water. The grayish huts were made of some kind of
            stones stuck together with some kind of whitish mortar. The boundary walls of huts were also made up of round stones. In this part there appears to be no concept of red bricks.
        </p>
        <p>
            What amazed me was the cleanliness of the countryside. The men and women were attired in dirty clothes and gave the impression of belonging to peasant class. The houses were all rectangular and grayish in colour even in Taklakot. There was some kind of
            frightening symmetry about the place. As if other colours and design had no place in Tibetan society except in the colour of their dresses. The size of the main road leading to the Guest House in Taklakot gave false impression about the size
            of the town hosting it. Somewhat like a man with short torso and long legs. The place where we stayed was called “Purang Guest House” with a huge main entrance leading to a courtyard in the middle of which was an administrative building.
        </p>
        <p>
            We alighted from the bus and were asked to assemble in the hall of this admin building in which we completed the usual irksome customs and immigration formalities. We were asked to fill a couple of forms. Then we were called one by one before a Chinese
            official who compared our photos in the passport with our faces. Since most had grown beards and were wearing caps we were asked to take off our headgear. They were painfully slow in completing this formality. What normally should not take
            more than half an hour took almost two hours. By this time the yatris were ravenously hungry. It was almost 2 in the afternoon.
        </p>
        <img class="art-img left" src="/img/adminbldg.jpeg" alt="Guru, our tour guide, in front of the admin building" />
        <p>
            The room in which we sat was a huge rectangular room in which were kept old sofas. We were served with tea while this formality was taking place. The tea was undrinkable by Indian standards. More water less tea and milk. We were asked to collect $ 701
            from each yatri and give it to the Chinese authorities. They gave me one receipt for thirty yatris and another for myself – because I would need it for settling the advance that I had taken from my office.
        </p>
        <p>
            After this we were shown to our rooms. My room was an old dingy little room with a huge window without curtains. It had two beds, a washstand and one locked wooden cupboard. There was a wire drawn temporarily to provide only one bulb connection. There
            was no switchboard. One very long string connected to a rotary switch was required to be pulled for switching the bulb on or off. A huge thermos flask containing very hot water was kept to provide round-the-clock hot water.
        </p>
        <p>
            We then went to the dining hall behind the admin building. It was neat and clean and appeared modern in huge contrast to the very despairing surroundings in which it stood. Between the admin building and the dining hall some feverish and pacy construction
            activity was going on. This we were later told was the new deluxe guesthouse for the yatri to be made operational from 14th batch. By the time we left Taklakot on our return journey this building was ready. The pace at which this building
            was made ready made an impression on all of us. However the quality of workmanship and fittings left a lot to be desired. I personally did not think that the building would survive for a long time. It would need frequent repairs and maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dining hall was huge and consisted of 6 round dining tables each of which was large enough to serve 8-10 yatris. Attached to it was a huge kitchen. Much of it was vacant. We were served with a bowl of tasteless red liquid with noodles floating in
            it. When we expressed our horror, the guide assured that dinner would suit our taste. Some yatris took out whatever eatables they had brought with them to fill up their belly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then we collected money to be paid to the Chinese authorities and to the guide for arranging ponies and porter. One quiet yatri from south was made the cashier. On the advice of the LO of the 8th batch I made it compulsory for all yatris to hire a pony
            and porter. Yatris from South India did not make an issue of this decision but a few others were a little dissatisfied. They were the most difficult to handle and very vocal about what must be done and not be done.
        </p>
        <p>
            I took US $21731 (701X31) to the office in Admin building. A middle-aged man with a young girl sat behind a desk. He was short and appeared to be sort of assistant manager of the guesthouse. He asked me to keep one $1 bill. I was perplexed. He could not
            tally the amount without that $1 bill. The girl counted the money while the man pored over a huge register. It obviously was the guest register. When the counting was over the man again asked me to give him back the $1 bill and laughed loudly.
            He must be thinking what a stupid person he was!!
        </p>
        <p>
            After this formality was over, we exchanged $4292 for yuan to be paid to Chinese for ponies and porters during Kailash Parikrama @ Y 250/day for pony and Y 100/day for porter. All these transactions took more than a couple of hours. Other yatris by this
            time had taken bath.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the bathrooms were not too bad, the toilets were most primitive. These were located at the farthest northeastern end of the guesthouse near servants’ quarter. One had to walk for about 50-100 meters to get there. They consisted of 6 rectangular
            blocks of concrete. An opening wide enough (two and a half feet) was provided to allow a yatri to get in. There was no door. Nor a roof. The rectangular block was 2 feet high. These blocks were housed in a large building one side of which
            had men’s toilet block, and on the other, the ladies’. In the middle of these row of blocks ran a slit 8” wide and 2 1⁄2 ‘ deep. One had to squat on the floor of this block with one leg on either side of the slit for shitting. There was no
            running water and one had to fetch a pan of water from the black plastic drum kept outside the building. These were dry latrines that have been banned in India. This is the biggest shock the yatris get in the yatra. Even the ladies’ block
            had no doors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The human excreta was flushed not more than twice a day. No wonder it was a stinking hole. The Chinese did not mind living in this kind of hellhole.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bathrooms appeared to be better and more modern. We were allowed the luxury of taking hot water bath at certain fixed times of the day – usually late afternoons. That was because the water had to be heated and stored.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the administrative issues were sorted out I took a bath and washed some clothes. Thereafter went out shopping and bought a knife and an orange fizz bottle for Y 5 each from a shop just next door. Paid in Indian currency Rs. 60.
        </p>
        <img class="art-img left" src="/img/taklakot.jpeg" alt="Taklakot town with little traffic on road" />
        <p>
            The town of Taklakot is small. There is only one main road whose width is terribly out of proportion to the size of the town. This road is about 60’ wide and all commercial activity of the town takes place from the shops located on either side of this
            road. The town as also the road gave the impression of a ghost town. There was no noise. Cars were not seen. Only pick-up van and large trucks occasionally plied on the road. There were no stalls or cabins on footpaths unlike in India. There
            were Nepali, Chinese and Indian markets at the far end of the road. There were very few trees. Could not identify them. The Agricultural Bank of China located on the street was a huge building. The banking transactions were done with the help
            of computers and modern gadgetry. The bank appeared to be networked. The cashier of our group, who was a banker, was impressed by the efficiency of the staff of the bank.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also brought a broad-rimmed hat to protect myself from the harmful effects of the Sun’s UV rays at this altitude. It was a good hat made out of plastic wide enough to protect me from both sun and rain for Y 5.
        </p>
        <p>
            The standard local time is ahead of IST by 2 1⁄2 hours. That keeps out darkness till about 9 o’clock.

        <h3>Day 13: Friday 3 August 2007</h3>
        <p>
            Slept well. Dreamt about some kind of journey. Got up at 5.30 am. It was pitch dark outside. Not a soul stirred. Started writing diary for want of anything better to do. Slept again after an hour.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again got up at 7.45 am. The breakfast at 8.30 am consisted of groundnuts, fried bread, a kind of fryums and something resembling idli. Yatris were fed up with the kind of food given to them. So we decided to ask our cooks to do the cooking for us.
            They prepared a typical Indian lunch for us and made all of us happy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Took shower at 11 am and headed for Googar Gompha. This Gompha is about 3 km west of the town. To go to Gompha one has to cross a bridge on the western extremity of the town and then turn left. The Gompha has been carved out from the face of a rock that
            is almost vertical. Walking up to the Gompha in this rarefied atmosphere is a strenuous exercise and I had to walk slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I walked up to the main courtyard of the Gompha which is situated on a hill. I then took a flight of steps leading up to the first floor of the gompha. I entered a huge dark room at the end of which was a narrow, metallic and steep staircase that led
            one to the first floor of the gompha. A lama or a caretaker was sitting inside. It was difficult to strike any meaningful conversation with him. Yet when I showed him my camera and asked by sign language whether I could take any pictures,
            he moved his forefinger over his thumb to indicate that money would be needed to do that. I showed him my wallet to indicate that I had only Indian currency. After a bit of haggling I gave him Rs. 120 and took back Y 10. So for Rs.70, I could
            freely film the gompha. I asked him to speak so that I could get it translated later. After spending about 45 minutes at the gompha, I headed back to the Guest house.

            Thereafter had lunch and exchanged $20 for Yuan. Went around the market. The market is unusually silent and traffic practically non-existent. The young women like to dress fashionably and the men, in general, except those in government service are casually
            dressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is 10 o’clock at night. I still see some daylight. The Chinese have wrongly put the clock ahead by two and a half hours even though its longitude is the same as Allahabad. They have adjusted the time to match it with Beijing time. After completing
            my diary I fell off to sleep.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 14: Saturday 4 August 2007</h3>
        <p>
            Woke up at 5 am. The absence of an attached toilet makes it very difficult to answer the call of nature at night, as it is very cold outside. We were informed that the breakfast was to be served at 8.30 am. All the yatris were ready by that time.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing that impressed all yatris was the thermos flasks kept for each yatri. They were very efficient and could keep the water really hot for close to 2 days. A few yatris took the trouble of buying these fragile flasks and carried them to India –
            they were cheap also. They used cork as lids and were housed in thin tin bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ramesh as usual came and packed my belongings. We all had the same kind of breakfast as the one given yesterday. Collected some peanuts and put them in packet for munching later.
        </p>
        <p>
            We started off for Darchen at 9.30 am after our customary prayers. About 8-10 local Tibetans also hopped on to the bus for a free ride to Darchen. The route after a few kilometers was dusty and pebbled. For the first 20 kms we could see wheat and mustard
            fields, but little sign of human activity that is so characteristic of Indian village. In India peasants work quite early in the morning to avoid working in the afternoon. These Tibetans must be working in the afternoons to avoid early morning
            chill.
        </p>
        <p>
            At a few places the pebbled road was used to channelise the water flowing from the mountains to irrigate fields. It was surprising to see water flowing on the road and get suddenly diverted to fields. At one such place Guru got down to fill up 2 cans
            of water to cool down the engine. He would pour water by sitting on the bonnet. The mountain ranges on all sides were desolate and were in various shades of brown, blue and gray. Some of them were clad in snow. One could see that the most
            common bird was the size of a lark. It was brownish gray in colour; had white distinctive patch at the base of the tail and a prominent black band at its tip.

        <p>
            One could not be expected to see trees at this height. But here and there green patches of grass and bushy undergrowth indicated presence of underground moisture.
        </p>
        <p>
            At 11.45 am we had the first glimpse of Rakshas Tal. It is called “Zhukso” in Tibet. It is a huge blue lake with an island at the center that looked black. Ravana is believed to have meditated here after he was denied permission to meditate in Mansarovar
            Lake by the gods. It is indescribably beautiful. Guru explained what it signifies. Everybody got down and took pictures of the lake. My batteries had packed off so I borrowed one set from Sh. R Somasundara. At the point where we got down,
            we could see that people had constructed little mounds of pebbles or stones. These had been made by yatris for their wishes to be fulfilled. Mount Kailash is visible from this place but today it is behind clouds.

            Looking at this desolate place I wondered why Lord Shiva chose to live in such inhospitable surroundings? Hundreds of miles away and thousands of feet above his devotees. After about an hour or so, we boarded our bus. Thereafter we negotiated a narrow
            stretch of land from where we could see ML. It appeared to be much smaller lake than RT but its religious importance cannot be gainsaid.
        </p>
        <p>
            After we had driven through the rugged Tibetan plateau for half an hour we reached Darchen Camp at about 3 in the afternoon. We were taken to a row of rooms whose verandah was covered by glass. A boundary wall enclosed these rooms. Attached to the boundary
            wall were two rows of toilets that were similar to the ones we had seen in Taklakot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Darchen is a small town and happens to be the gateway to MK. Yatris stay here for the night before starting its parikrama. It has a very small population and it serves the pilgrims that arrive here for darshan of MK.
        </p>
        <p>
            We quickly had our afternoon tea prepared by our cooks. Then Guru arranged 6 Land Cruisers @ Y30 a yatri for us to be taken to Ashtapad. Ashtapad is 8-10 kms from Darchen and the road passes through mountain on NE side of the town. From there the southern
            face of MK is visible. The Land Cruisers wended its way towards a small hill and after crossing a few streams we had our first darshan of MK. All the yatris were ecstatic. After all they had come to see this. They had undergone so much of
            hardship only to be able to see this abode of Lord Shiva. They started chanting Om Namah Shivay in unison.
        </p>
        <img class="art-img left" src="/img/samadhi.jpeg" alt="Samadhi of first Jain Tirthankar Rishabhmuniji at Ashtapad" />
        <p>
            We had very good views of MK, Nandi Parbat, first Jain tirthankar “Rishabh’s” samadhi sthal and Ashtapad mountain. As one approaches MK, the samadhi is towards the right on top of a small hillock. The Ashtapad is on our left towards Mount Kailash and
            Nandi Parbat on our right ahead of samadhi. The snow that melts from MK forms a stream that we crossed to climb the hillock to see the samadhi. We prayed there and laid prostrate before MK. Yatris collected water from the stream believed to
            be Ganga as it flows from MK. I could see elation on the face of yatris on getting this life-long ambition fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for me I was mesmerized by the sheer beauty of MK, prayed for peace and prosperity of mankind and laid prostrate before it. I also like other yatris did Parikrama of samadhi and collected a handful of soil and stone from the samadhi to be taken home.
        </p>
        <p>
            After we had spent over an hour we came back to our camp. By this time our cooks had kept dinner ready. It consisted of rice, subzi, and dal. It tasted delicious. Never had I eaten so much of rice in one meal in my lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thereafter I bought 2 spare sets of batteries for Y20; made call to my home; and wrote diary. Then saw black-headed gull in breeding plumage foraging among rubbish during a walk in and around the camp of Darchen.
