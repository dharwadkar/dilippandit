        <h3>Day 1: Sunday 22 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            The date for which I was waiting for such a long time since my selection as Liaison Office (LO) in April has at last arrived. I shall be meeting yatris today at Hearts and Lungs Hospital on Panchkuian Road Delhi. I had been applying for this post for
            the last several years and I was fifth time lucky this year. I felt that if Lord Shiva wants me to come to His abode in Mount Kailash (MK), He would make conditions propitious for my selection. I was clear in my mind that if I were ever to
            go to MK and Mansarovar Lake (ML) it would be not because of my efforts but because of His inscrutable ways of getting things done in His own inimitable style. He also selects the time. I was certain that it was He who would make conditions
            favourable for my selection. It was His desire that I would be fulfilling if I were to be selected. Of course I would be doing all that was expected of me. Such as filling up form; getting for myself clearances and sanctions from government
            departments and appearing for interview in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).
        </p>
        <p>
            The sky was overcast. It had probably rained a little in the morning, as the dried droplets on cars seemed to suggest. I noticed them on my way to the neighbourhood park in the morning for my customary morning walk. Did some yoga and pranayama exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was on the way to the Hospital at about 10. I dressed casually to lend an air of informality to my interactions with yatris. Looked forward to meeting them. They would be my companions for the next one-month. They had agreed to place both their fate
            and faith in my hands on the advice and directive of Ministry of External Affairs that had selected me as pilgrims’ LO. A slew of questions crossed my mind. In what health would they be? What would be their fears and concerns? What kind of
            bonding would result as a result of this yatra? What could possibly be their age profile? I was going to be their LO and what did they expect from me? I had no clue to the answers of these questions at this stage. Will I ever have all the
            answers to the questions? I do not know.
        </p>
        <p>
            These thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of car at the hospital. As I entered the main gate I espied Mr. Joshi PRO (Public Relations Officer) of
            <a href="http://kmvn.in/ target=" blank ">Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd. (KMVN)</a> authoritatively sitting behind a desk arranged thoughtfully by the Hospital at a conspicuous place in the reception area meant for patients and their relatives. He was helping yatris generally and collecting their passports for getting group visa from the Chinese embassy. Mr. Joshi was dark, in early forties and had red teeth that suggested his addiction to that typically south Asian habit of chewing betel leaves. I had met him earlier and found him to be amiable. Mr. Joshi informed me that only 34 yatris have reported for medical examination. I was exultant. Smaller the group, better the management, I thought in my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then began a series of informal meeting with Yatris who were going about their business of getting themselves medically examined at different places in the hospital. All yatris could be identified by the red ribbon that had been pinned to their shirts or sarees. I was astonished to see a lean old man in white cotton shirt and dhoti with gray cropped hair walking briskly from one place to another. He appeared to be in either late sixties or early seventies. He was as straight as a ramrod and as lean as a reed. I made a mental note of this yatri as probably the oldest of the lot. A few yatris were sitting at a coffee counter chatting among themselves. When I walked up to them and introduced myself, a few were genuinely pleased while others were relieved. Don’t know why? A majority of Yatris appeared to be from Karnataka; from Bangalore and Mysore. It appeared to me that ladies were more than gents. But I was wrong in this assumption. Average age of Yatris? Around 45+. All of them were in the last stages of physical and mental preparation of yatra. I was glad that my batch was small and easy, so it seemed from whatever discussions I had with them. The purpose of my meeting them was to initially break the ice and get to know them better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Joshi in his typical officious manner asked whether I got my passport with me. Since I had not been advised to bring it with me, I could not give him one. He advised me to deliver it to Mr. Dalpati of MEA direct tomorrow by 11 so that action for obtaining group visa could be taken by him.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was getting close to noon when I left yatris to their devices and went home.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 2: Monday 23 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            In the morning Mr. Dalpati called on my cell to inform me that he needed my passport urgently. I told him that I would come and give it to him by 11.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dropped in at MEA and handed over my passport to Dalpati. He asked me to collect the Satellite Phone in the afternoon. The man was pleasant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Went to Tigri Camp of Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) where Yatris were summoned for further medical examination. Those who were declared medically fit were obviously elated, while those who were not fit were disappointed. About 4-5 yatris were referred to Batra Hospital for a second opinion. Here I got further opportunity to mingle with the yatris. After the examination was over, all the yatris were called to the first floor hall, where lunch for them was arranged by a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO). We were given water, lemon juice and a well-organized lunch that included I think gulab jamuns. We were also given waist strap pouch containing Maggi soup powder, Nescafe pouches, and puja samagri. This was preceded by recitation of prayers to Lord Shiva. After one NGO had gone others came and gave yatris lectures on how to look after oneself during the yatra.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got bored with all this stuff and did a disappearing act. I was later informed that the NGOs had also given rations to the yatris for preparing food in China in four big sacks. Even a medical kit was given that contained, among essential medicines, a stethoscope and a BP instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I was leaving the Base Hospital a young man whom I did not recognize accosted me. He said that he would be leaving his old parents in my care during the yatra, and although he did not say it but from the way his eyes spoke, I understood that he wanted some words of assurance from me that they would be looked after well. I made some reassuring noises that seemed to satisfy him. It was then that I realized the enormity of responsibility that I had assumed and felt terribly humbled.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 3: Tuesday 23 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            The day had been set apart for briefing by the MEA at Hotel Akbar from where a few offices of MEA and Ministry of Overseas India Affairs function. While we all were waiting in the compound of the hotel for someone in authority come and take us inside, I noticed a young girl in about mid thirties, in tight jeans and black t-shirt standing at the entrance. She had a round face. Her hair fell freely over her shoulders. She clutched a file in her hands and was generally waiting for someone or something. I later on found out that she was the one who was invited by KMVN to brief yatris that day. She has, it seemed gone to KM a number of times and enchanted by her experience, given up her job in an MNC and was organizing trips to KM via Nepal.
        </p>
        <p>
            We all were shepherded to the conference hall that had the capacity to sit about 70. I, this girl, Mr. Joshi, and Dalpati were on dais and were later on joined by Mr. Anil Kumar Under Secretary (EA) of MEA.
        </p>
        <p>
            The girl made her points forcefully and said that the religious significance of the yatra must never be lost sight of. We must make an attempt to shed our cultural, and regional identities, ego, vanity and prejudices in order to truly benefit from that Yatra. Then she advised all the yatris how to look after themselves and in what spirit must the trekking in the Himalayas be undertaken. She also gave a day-to-day account of the yatra and what to expect on those days.
        </p>
        <p>
            After her briefing was over, I also spoke to the yatris for a few minutes. I told them that I felt honored to be their LO and looked forward to spending the next one month with them. I further advised them that they should not hide any discomforts from me. I said that I looked forward to their cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the briefing, all the yatris paid Rs.15500/- to KMVN and that took a long time. Meanwhile I slipped out of the Akbar Hotel and went to Ashoka Hotel (HA) from where dollars were to be purchased. The man at the Central Bank of India’s counter in HA was perhaps looking forward to an early lunch and appeared to be annoyed to see me. There was only one man waiting for his turn. Since he was taking a very long time to fill up the form, the manager allowed me to jump the queue. He quickly gave me a form to fill for drawing foreign exchange. I filled it up. I took US$ 900 at the exchange rate of Rs.41.20 to a dollar. While leaving him I forewarned him to expect a group of about 30 yatris to descend on his branch for collecting foreign exchange. He said he would have enough dollars for 30 if not more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, I went to the Connaught Place (A popular shopping area in New Delhi) and bought a 2 GB memory card for the camera. It was Nikon A 400 with 3.2 MP. The card cost me Rs.1250. Then I went home and started packing for the trip.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 4: Wednesday 25 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            The day of departure finally arrived. Had a good night’s sleep. Got up early and after taking leave of the family members left for Gujarat Samaj Sadan at 5.45 am from where the bus to Kathgodam was to leave. The weather was cloudy and humid. Temperature in late 20s. Roads were empty, although one could see an odd vehicle or two. Streetlights were glowing in daylight. A TATA 407 vehicle had overturned near the Defence Colony flyover. As we were cruising along on that road, 4-5 bulls and cows came charging down the road giving enormous fright to the driver. Reached the Samaj Building without any further ado.
        </p>
        <p>
            Saw that an NGO (Dharma Sanstha Samiti) was holding an elaborate farewell function to facilitate the yatris. A priest was chanting prayer and the yatris were being garlanded and given some puja samagri. A bright yellow and red polyester scarf was being draped around the shoulders of yatris. A beaded rosary, a pouch containing puja samagri and a bottle of mineral water were given to them. The priest also made a short speech saying that Lord Shiva is different from all gods inasmuch as when other gods were asked to choose their homes to settle, only He chose to settle on earth among his devotees. He also mentioned that the pouch contains “Bilvapatra” a favourite of Lord Shiva and among all the offerings made to Him, this particular offering can be brought back and kept in homes.
        </p>
        <p>
            When asked to say a few words, I thanked the NGO for all the trouble they took in bidding us farewell and for their kind and magnanimous words. I said we all need their blessing for completing the yatra successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            All these formalities were delaying us. I asked KMVN officials to start loading the luggage immediately so that we could leave as soon as possible. We finally left Delhi at 6.45. As soon the 53 seater a/c bus rolled out of Delhi, the yatris started singing Shiva’s name, slokas, bhajan and popular Shiva sangeet. A few ladies took out booklets and started reading slokas and hymns from them. At 8 we reached Ghaziabad, where we stopped at a hotel where another NGO had kept an elaborate function to facilitate us. Speeches were made. I thanked them for their encouraging words. One of the persons there presented me with a whistle the purpose of which I reckoned was to call all yatris should they be playing truant. I liked that. I had to use the whistle immediately to tell yatris that it was time to depart. They had arranged breakfast for all of us. After we had partaken of their hospitality we left the place at 9.
        </p>
        <p>
            The vehicle in which we were traveling appeared to be an old one. Although its a/c was working well, the seats could not be adjusted. If they were in slide back position they remained in that position and could not be brought to upright position. It was painful. The driver’s cabin was occupied by a couple of youngsters who kept him busy with incessant chat. Since the roads in UP are full of potholes and have been made narrower than they are by human encroachments and chaotic traffic, the ride was jerky and, of necessity, slow. The driver was adding to the jitters by talking incessantly on mobile and not caring two hoots about traffic safety.
        </p>
        <p>
            No sooner did we leave towns behind than we were treated to lush green countryside. Peasants and labourers were working on the fields. The roadsides were lined with Mahaneem, sheesham trees. The streams and rivulets were full of flowing water thanks to the bountiful monsoon. Egrets were busy picking up insects from host animals’ body.
        </p>
        <p>
            We had to endure the pain of traveling through the UP countryside for close to 5 hours before we crossed over to Uttarakhand. The roads thereafter became smoother. Ms. Promptly sang a few bhajans and filmi songs. She had mellifluous voice and had apparently taken some lessons in classical singing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amid a few yawns and general ennui, reached Kathgodam at 3 in the afternoon. The management of the KMVN guest house had made elaborate arrangement to welcome us with garlands and a glass of lemonade. The guest house is just by the side of the main narrow road. One actually has to step on to the road to go to the dining hall from the rooms. If you were not aware of the location of the guest house then you were likely to miss it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We finally had our lunch consisting of dal, rice, sabzi and chapati. We liked it. But little did we realize that this kind of food was going to be our staple diet for the next one month and would ultimately make yatris pine for home-cooked food.
        </p>
        <p>
            We left Kathgodam after shifting into two smaller buses. One was about 25 seater and the other 10 seater bus. Smaller buses are necessary in the hills to negotiate road curves on them. I noticed that Baggage Committee members who were supposed to supervise the shifting of baggage from the bigger to smaller buses were not performing their jobs properly. On way the driver allowed KMVN staff to load two small gensets in the aisle crowding it further. I was in a smaller bus with about 10 yatris and the remaining yatris were in a bigger bus that was driven ahead of us. The tedium of the journey was being relieved by occasional singing of bhajans and slokas. After about an hour or so we were in a sort of valley where a village called Kaichi Dham nestled. The driver stopped the bus in front of a temple that had been built amid sylvan surroundings. We all got down and went inside the temple to have darshan of deities. It was dusk and the light had begun to fade. Arti was imminent. The only thing that amazed me was the presence of a large number of foreigners in that temple who were dressed in typically Indian clothes. The ladies wearing Salwar-Kameez and gents kurta pyjamas. The temple had all the major deities that Hindus worship – Vaishno Devi being the most prominent there. But the major temple hosted the statue of the founder of the temple whom the foreigners worshipped. He was called Neem Karoli Baba.
        </p>
        <p>
            After spending about 20 minutes at this idyllic place, we started climbing once again and without any further ado reached Almora at 8 in the night.
        </p>
        <p>
            The KMVN guest house at Almora is situated at a height and is approachable through a narrow road. One had to climb a flight of around 30 steps to reach the reception area. Our luggage remained on the bus as we were forewarned that we would have to do without it at Almora. We retired to our rooms after having our dinner. I informed all the yatris that we plan to leave by 5 am in the morning, as it would take at least 12 hours to reach Dharchula. I also instructed Raju to wake everybody up by 4.15 am and serve them tea. For me, I gave him detailed instructions on how to prepare filter coffee that I had brought along with me for the journey.
