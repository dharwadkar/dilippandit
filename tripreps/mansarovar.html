        </h3>
        <h3>Day 1: Sunday 22 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            The date for which I was waiting for such a long time since my selection as Liaison Office (LO) in April has at last arrived. I shall be meeting yatris today at Hearts and Lungs Hospital on Panchkuian Road Delhi. I had been applying for this post for
            the last several years and I was fifth time lucky this year. I felt that if Lord Shiva wants me to come to His abode in Mount Kailash (MK), He would make conditions propitious for my selection. I was clear in my mind that if I were ever to
            go to MK and Mansarovar Lake (ML) it would be not because of my efforts but because of His inscrutable ways of getting things done in His own inimitable style. He also selects the time. I was certain that it was He who would make conditions
            favourable for my selection. It was His desire that I would be fulfilling if I were to be selected. Of course I would be doing all that was expected of me. Such as filling up form; getting for myself clearances and sanctions from government
            departments and appearing for interview in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).
        </p>
        <p>
            The sky was overcast. It had probably rained a little in the morning, as the dried droplets on cars seemed to suggest. I noticed them on my way to the neighbourhood park in the morning for my customary morning walk. Did some yoga and pranayama exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was on the way to the Hospital at about 10. I dressed casually to lend an air of informality to my interactions with yatris. Looked forward to meeting them. They would be my companions for the next one-month. They had agreed to place both their fate
            and faith in my hands on the advice and directive of Ministry of External Affairs that had selected me as pilgrims’ LO. A slew of questions crossed my mind. In what health would they be? What would be their fears and concerns? What kind of
            bonding would result as a result of this yatra? What could possibly be their age profile? I was going to be their LO and what did they expect from me? I had no clue to the answers of these questions at this stage. Will I ever have all the
            answers to the questions? I do not know.
        </p>
        <p>
            These thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of car at the hospital. As I entered the main gate I espied Mr. Joshi PRO (Public Relations Officer) of
            <a href="http://kmvn.in/" target="_blank">Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd. (KMVN)</a> authoritatively sitting behind a desk arranged thoughtfully by the Hospital at a conspicuous place in the reception area meant for patients and their relatives.
            He was helping yatris generally and collecting their passports for getting group visa from the Chinese embassy. Mr. Joshi was dark, in early forties and had red teeth that suggested his addiction to that typically south Asian habit of chewing
            betel leaves. I had met him earlier and found him to be amiable. Mr. Joshi informed me that only 34 yatris have reported for medical examination. I was exultant. Smaller the group, better the management, I thought in my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then began a series of informal meeting with Yatris who were going about their business of getting themselves medically examined at different places in the hospital. All yatris could be identified by the red ribbon that had been pinned to their shirts
            or sarees. I was astonished to see a lean old man in white cotton shirt and dhoti with gray cropped hair walking briskly from one place to another. He appeared to be in either late sixties or early seventies. He was as straight as a ramrod
            and as lean as a reed. I made a mental note of this yatri as probably the oldest of the lot. A few yatris were sitting at a coffee counter chatting among themselves. When I walked up to them and introduced myself, a few were genuinely pleased
            while others were relieved. Don’t know why? A majority of Yatris appeared to be from Karnataka; from Bangalore and Mysore. It appeared to me that ladies were more than gents. But I was wrong in this assumption. Average age of Yatris? Around
            45+. All of them were in the last stages of physical and mental preparation of yatra. I was glad that my batch was small and easy, so it seemed from whatever discussions I had with them. The purpose of my meeting them was to initially break
            the ice and get to know them better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Joshi in his typical officious manner asked whether I got my passport with me. Since I had not been advised to bring it with me, I could not give him one. He advised me to deliver it to Mr. Dalpati of MEA direct tomorrow by 11 so that action for obtaining
            group visa could be taken by him.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was getting close to noon when I left yatris to their devices and went home.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 2: Monday 23 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            In the morning Mr. Dalpati called on my cell to inform me that he needed my passport urgently. I told him that I would come and give it to him by 11.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dropped in at MEA and handed over my passport to Dalpati. He asked me to collect the Satellite Phone in the afternoon. The man was pleasant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Went to Tigri Camp of Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) where Yatris were summoned for further medical examination. Those who were declared medically fit were obviously elated, while those who were not fit were disappointed. About 4-5 yatris were referred
            to Batra Hospital for a second opinion. Here I got further opportunity to mingle with the yatris. After the examination was over, all the yatris were called to the first floor hall, where lunch for them was arranged by a Non-Governmental Organization
            (NGO). We were given water, lemon juice and a well-organized lunch that included I think gulab jamuns. We were also given waist strap pouch containing Maggi soup powder, Nescafe pouches, and puja samagri. This was preceded by recitation of
            prayers to Lord Shiva. After one NGO had gone others came and gave yatris lectures on how to look after oneself during the yatra.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got bored with all this stuff and did a disappearing act. I was later informed that the NGOs had also given rations to the yatris for preparing food in China in four big sacks. Even a medical kit was given that contained, among essential medicines,
            a stethoscope and a BP instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I was leaving the Base Hospital a young man whom I did not recognize accosted me. He said that he would be leaving his old parents in my care during the yatra, and although he did not say it but from the way his eyes spoke, I understood that he
            wanted some words of assurance from me that they would be looked after well. I made some reassuring noises that seemed to satisfy him. It was then that I realized the enormity of responsibility that I had assumed and felt terribly humbled.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 3: Tuesday 23 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            The day had been set apart for briefing by the MEA at Hotel Akbar from where a few offices of MEA and Ministry of Overseas India Affairs function. While we all were waiting in the compound of the hotel for someone in authority come and take us inside,
            I noticed a young girl in about mid thirties, in tight jeans and black t-shirt standing at the entrance. She had a round face. Her hair fell freely over her shoulders. She clutched a file in her hands and was generally waiting for someone
            or something. I later on found out that she was the one who was invited by KMVN to brief yatris that day. She has, it seemed gone to KM a number of times and enchanted by her experience, given up her job in an MNC and was organizing trips
            to KM via Nepal.
        </p>
        <p>
            We all were shepherded to the conference hall that had the capacity to sit about 70. I, this girl, Mr. Joshi, and Dalpati were on dais and were later on joined by Mr. Anil Kumar Under Secretary (EA) of MEA.
        </p>
        <p>
            The girl made her points forcefully and said that the religious significance of the yatra must never be lost sight of. We must make an attempt to shed our cultural, and regional identities, ego, vanity and prejudices in order to truly benefit from that
            Yatra. Then she advised all the yatris how to look after themselves and in what spirit must the trekking in the Himalayas be undertaken. She also gave a day-to-day account of the yatra and what to expect on those days.
        </p>
        <p>
            After her briefing was over, I also spoke to the yatris for a few minutes. I told them that I felt honored to be their LO and looked forward to spending the next one month with them. I further advised them that they should not hide any discomforts from
            me. I said that I looked forward to their cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the briefing, all the yatris paid Rs.15500/- to KMVN and that took a long time. Meanwhile I slipped out of the Akbar Hotel and went to Ashoka Hotel (HA) from where dollars were to be purchased. The man at the Central Bank of India’s counter in HA
            was perhaps looking forward to an early lunch and appeared to be annoyed to see me. There was only one man waiting for his turn. Since he was taking a very long time to fill up the form, the manager allowed me to jump the queue. He quickly
            gave me a form to fill for drawing foreign exchange. I filled it up. I took US$ 900 at the exchange rate of Rs.41.20 to a dollar. While leaving him I forewarned him to expect a group of about 30 yatris to descend on his branch for collecting
            foreign exchange. He said he would have enough dollars for 30 if not more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, I went to the Connaught Place (A popular shopping area in New Delhi) and bought a 2 GB memory card for the camera. It was Nikon A 400 with 3.2 MP. The card cost me Rs.1250. Then I went home and started packing for the trip.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 4: Wednesday 25 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            The day of departure finally arrived. Had a good night’s sleep. Got up early and after taking leave of the family members left for Gujarat Samaj Sadan at 5.45 am from where the bus to Kathgodam was to leave. The weather was cloudy and humid. Temperature
            in late 20s. Roads were empty, although one could see an odd vehicle or two. Streetlights were glowing in daylight. A TATA 407 vehicle had overturned near the Defence Colony flyover. As we were cruising along on that road, 4-5 bulls and cows
            came charging down the road giving enormous fright to the driver. Reached the Samaj Building without any further ado.
        </p>
        <p>
            Saw that an NGO (Dharma Sanstha Samiti) was holding an elaborate farewell function to facilitate the yatris. A priest was chanting prayer and the yatris were being garlanded and given some puja samagri. A bright yellow and red polyester scarf was being
            draped around the shoulders of yatris. A beaded rosary, a pouch containing puja samagri and a bottle of mineral water were given to them. The priest also made a short speech saying that Lord Shiva is different from all gods inasmuch as when
            other gods were asked to choose their homes to settle, only He chose to settle on earth among his devotees. He also mentioned that the pouch contains “Bilvapatra” a favourite of Lord Shiva and among all the offerings made to Him, this particular
            offering can be brought back and kept in homes.
        </p>
        <p>
            When asked to say a few words, I thanked the NGO for all the trouble they took in bidding us farewell and for their kind and magnanimous words. I said we all need their blessing for completing the yatra successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            All these formalities were delaying us. I asked KMVN officials to start loading the luggage immediately so that we could leave as soon as possible. We finally left Delhi at 6.45. As soon the 53 seater a/c bus rolled out of Delhi, the yatris started singing
            Shiva’s name, slokas, bhajan and popular Shiva sangeet. A few ladies took out booklets and started reading slokas and hymns from them. At 8 we reached Ghaziabad, where we stopped at a hotel where another NGO had kept an elaborate function
            to facilitate us. Speeches were made. I thanked them for their encouraging words. One of the persons there presented me with a whistle the purpose of which I reckoned was to call all yatris should they be playing truant. I liked that. I had
            to use the whistle immediately to tell yatris that it was time to depart. They had arranged breakfast for all of us. After we had partaken of their hospitality we left the place at 9.
        </p>
        <p>
            The vehicle in which we were traveling appeared to be an old one. Although its a/c was working well, the seats could not be adjusted. If they were in slide back position they remained in that position and could not be brought to upright position. It was
            painful. The driver’s cabin was occupied by a couple of youngsters who kept him busy with incessant chat. Since the roads in UP are full of potholes and have been made narrower than they are by human encroachments and chaotic traffic, the
            ride was jerky and, of necessity, slow. The driver was adding to the jitters by talking incessantly on mobile and not caring two hoots about traffic safety.
        </p>
        <p>
            No sooner did we leave towns behind than we were treated to lush green countryside. Peasants and labourers were working on the fields. The roadsides were lined with Mahaneem, sheesham trees. The streams and rivulets were full of flowing water thanks to
            the bountiful monsoon. Egrets were busy picking up insects from host animals’ body.
        </p>
        <p>
            We had to endure the pain of traveling through the UP countryside for close to 5 hours before we crossed over to Uttarakhand. The roads thereafter became smoother. Ms. Promptly sang a few bhajans and filmi songs. She had mellifluous voice and had apparently
            taken some lessons in classical singing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amid a few yawns and general ennui, reached Kathgodam at 3 in the afternoon. The management of the KMVN guest house had made elaborate arrangement to welcome us with garlands and a glass of lemonade. The guest house is just by the side of the main narrow
            road. One actually has to step on to the road to go to the dining hall from the rooms. If you were not aware of the location of the guest house then you were likely to miss it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We finally had our lunch consisting of dal, rice, sabzi and chapati. We liked it. But little did we realize that this kind of food was going to be our staple diet for the next one month and would ultimately make yatris pine for home-cooked food.
        </p>
        <p>
            We left Kathgodam after shifting into two smaller buses. One was about 25 seater and the other 10 seater bus. Smaller buses are necessary in the hills to negotiate road curves on them. I noticed that Baggage Committee members who were supposed to supervise
            the shifting of baggage from the bigger to smaller buses were not performing their jobs properly. On way the driver allowed KMVN staff to load two small gensets in the aisle crowding it further. I was in a smaller bus with about 10 yatris
            and the remaining yatris were in a bigger bus that was driven ahead of us. The tedium of the journey was being relieved by occasional singing of bhajans and slokas. After about an hour or so we were in a sort of valley where a village called
            Kaichi Dham nestled. The driver stopped the bus in front of a temple that had been built amid sylvan surroundings. We all got down and went inside the temple to have darshan of deities. It was dusk and the light had begun to fade. Arti was
            imminent. The only thing that amazed me was the presence of a large number of foreigners in that temple who were dressed in typically Indian clothes. The ladies wearing Salwar-Kameez and gents kurta pyjamas. The temple had all the major deities
            that Hindus worship – Vaishno Devi being the most prominent there. But the major temple hosted the statue of the founder of the temple whom the foreigners worshipped. He was called Neem Karoli Baba.
        </p>
        <p>
            After spending about 20 minutes at this idyllic place, we started climbing once again and without any further ado reached Almora at 8 in the night.
        </p>
        <p>
            The KMVN guest house at Almora is situated at a height and is approachable through a narrow road. One had to climb a flight of around 30 steps to reach the reception area. Our luggage remained on the bus as we were forewarned that we would have to do
            without it at Almora. We retired to our rooms after having our dinner. I informed all the yatris that we plan to leave by 5 am in the morning, as it would take at least 12 hours to reach Dharchula. I also instructed Raju to wake everybody
            up by 4.15 am and serve them tea. For me, I gave him detailed instructions on how to prepare filter coffee that I had brought along with me for the journey.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 5: Thursday 26 July 2007</h3>

            I slept well. My room was the best in the guesthouse. Got up at 4 am; took a bath and had great filter coffee prepared by Raju. I was ready by 4.45 am and as I went down the corridor to go down to the ground floor, blew the whistle to alert yatris. The
            old couple from Maharashtra was ready and waiting in front of the guest house. The younger lot took more time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weather was sultry and not too comfortable, but outside, cool breeze blew. We left at 5.15 am after reciting Shiva Vandana. Stopped at the Mall by the side of a restaurant where one of the yatris had arranged tea and breakfast for us. This yatri was
            from Almora and wanted to fete yatris. Who could have objection to that? We were served with samosa, a piece of sweetmeat (an Almora speciality) and namkeen. After spending one hour at that place, left for Dharchula.
        </p>
        <p>
            While passing through the town could not help but notice that smaller towns are in a sense uglier than major ones. There were bent electrical poles on which garish posters hung just by a thread of a nut. The beauty of the place was marred by huge and
            out of shape billboards announcing accommodation at some resort or the other. Narrow and open drains were clogged with plastic that announced graduation to modernity. All this and more made one look with despair at the pace of progress that
            overlooked simple ways to make towns look pretty and clean.
        </p>
        <p>
            The serpentine road passed through mountainous terrain. A leopard protected area suddenly appeared and just as suddenly disappeared from view. The berm was covered with red dried pine leaves. Mountain streams were cantering along the boulder strewn slope.
            All around one could see different hues of only green colour. Terraced slopes of mountains sides indicated patchy farming by the villagers. At Beri Nag the guide who accompanied us got down to telephonically inform the KMVN at Chakori that
            we would be arriving for lunch at about 1 pm in the afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
            We arrived at Chakori at about lunchtime. The place is a little known hill station. The KMVN guest house is located inside a large compound and overlooks a very pretty valley. A row of tourist huts has been constructed to accommodate wanderers who may
            accidentally reach this place. It is a wonderful place for sure. But how many know about this town? There is a 30 feet high watchtower that allows one to look at a breathtaking view of the valley. All yatris climbed the tower to take photographs
            and videos.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the lunch, we left the place at about 2.30 pm and had barely gone about 10 kms when one of the passengers discovered that he had left behind the carry bag of a very expensive camera at Chakori near a tree. He wanted to know whether we could turn
            back and get the camera bag. It was difficult to turn back as it would have meant delay in reaching Dharchula. Nevertheless, I promised to do something about it. We got in touch with the Manager of KMVN, Chakori who had by then left for home.
            A few cell phones were working while others were not. While we were debating about what to do, we saw that a motorcyclist was washing his vehicle beside a stream that flowed by the side of the road. This was just 4 kms before Thal. We dropped
            our KMVN guide there and requested the motorcyclist to take him to Chakori and get the camera bag back. The motorcyclist as well as the guide were tipped generously by the yatri.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reached ITBP camp at Mirthi at 3pm. We were escorted by a ITBP vehicle that came to fetch us about 10 kms before the camp. Here we were to be briefed by the commandant on how to take care of ourselves during the yatra as well as the do's and don’ts.
        </p>
        <p>
            We spent about an hour at the camp and the lasting impression I have of the briefing was that it was done with clock like precision. We were served with tea and snacks at the end of the briefing. The Commandant informed us that only one batch before us
            had come back with all yatris in good health. Some of the things he said were as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Each human being is different and reacts and responds differently to the same stimuli.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Be humble
                </li>
                <li>We would be trekking on the traditional route followed for ages.</li>
                <li>The yatra was closed in 1962 and reopened in 1982.</li>
                <li>Dhauliganga meets kaliganga at Tawaghat.</li>
                <li>The route would be Budhi (2740m) – 3km – Chiyyalekh (3350m) – 6km – Garbanga (3181m) – 11 kms – Gunji (3600m) – 10 kms – Kalapani (3570m) – 9kms – Nabidang – Lipulekh pass (5073m)</li>
                <li>ITBP Inmarsat nos would be:-
                    <ol>
                        <li>Garbayang 00-873761105942</li>
                        <li>Gunji 00- 873761105944</li>
                        <li>Kalapani 00- 873761105940</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>A trekker gets mentally tired and not physically. Daler Mehndi danced for 2 hours after 40 kms of route march.</li>
                <li>Have positive thoughts.</li>
                <li>Avoid horse riding from Gala to Budhi.</li>
                <li>Check passport and purse physically before starting on the day’s trek.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            After tea and snacks were served we were taken for group photographs. A place had been thoughtfully selected and chairs kept there to take group photographs of yatris. We were told that on our way back each yatri would be given one copy of the photograph.
        </p>
        <p>
            We left Mirthi at 4 pm after thanking the Commandant for his hospitality. At 5 pm our bus came to a halt by the side of river close to a town called Golgatai. Just before the confluence of Kaliganga and Goriganga, a huge rock had fallen on the road. It
            was about 5 feet thick. Traffic had come to a standstill. The rock had apparently fallen at 10 am in the morning and the workers were using sledgehammers to break it down. It was a huge task. On the other side of the road was the bank of the
            river on which were built houses. So the broken pieces of rocks could not be pushed down the gorge. Nor could dynamite be used to blast off the rock. The workers finally managed to create a small space for the bus to pass at about 8 pm by
            which time darkness fell.
        </p>
        <p>
            After meandering through the hilly terrain for another hour we finally reached Dharchula at 8.45 pm in the night. The town of Dharchula is small and has very narrow roads that allow only a medium-sized bus to pass. Shops on either side of the roads make
            them dangerous for pedestrians. Stone-slabs covered the drain haphazardly. Pigs were loitering around even in the dark. The guest house is on the bank of a rapidly flowing river whose roaring sound could be heard for at least a mile.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was privileged to be accorded a VIP status and given a double-bed room when 4-5 yatris had to share a room. The luggage was unloaded and after a gap of two days. We would now be able to change our clothes.
        </p>
        <p>
            After ascertaining the requirements of yatris, I informed KMVN officials that we needed 25 ponies and 24 porters. Besides 2 cooks and 2 assistant cooks were also hired for yatra.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 6: Friday 27 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            It had rained all night. Woke up early. Switched on TV. And then switched it off. Boring. Went to the small semi-circular balcony and saw the mighty river raucously winding its way down the hill warning stragglers on its bank to stay away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coffee came. Had bath. Called porters and asked them to pack my bags. Went down and found that people had started packing bags. This at 7.30. The packets placed by the yatris in the foyer of the hotel were counted one by one and weighed. Then they were
            loaded onto the bus. All this took over an hour. Meanwhile a few packets were left unidentified because the yatris had played truant. After this experience I collected yatris and told them:
            <ol>
                <li>To inform me whenever they go anywhere on their own.</li>
                <li>To identify their luggage whenever it is loaded on the bus.</li>
                <li>Neither increase nor decrease the number of baggages.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            After that we left for Tawaghat at 8.20 am. The way to Tawaghat winded its way along the sides of hills that surrounded the valley in which flowed the mighty Kaliganga. Numerous waterfalls sliced through the hillsides making all of us nervous. The bus
            literally passed at many places under the waterfalls and we all had to close windows to prevent water from drenching us.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we had feared our journey came to an abrupt halt after covering only 20 kms. A huge landslide had blocked the road. As I got down and started taking pictures a huge monster of a terribly noisy bulldozer came hurtling down the road. It went to the landslide
            and started clearing debris. About 50 uniformed men were already busy removing the rubble. We feared that it might take one full day to clear the amount of rubble that had blocked the road.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile a jeep from <a href="http://www.nhpcindia.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">National HydroElectric Power Corporation (NHPC)</a> came and offered us soft drinks and biscuits. When it appeared that there was no way the road could be cleared
            in an hour or two, Yatra Ahikari of KMVN informed us that we might have to cross the road on foot. So we took off our shoes, collected our personal belongings and slowly crossed the landslides on which an enormous amount of water was flowing.
            A few ladies found it difficult to cross the landslide but ultimately managed to cross with the help of guides and porters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thereafter KMVN managed to hire three jeeps on the other side of the landslide and we started moving at 10 am. We had to cover about 20 kms before our trek to Gala could begin. After about 8 km the jeep in which I was traveling developed mechanical fault.
            Its clutch wire snapped. Our driver then stopped a vehicle that was coming from opposite direction and literally forced the lone lady occupant of that vehicle to alight and make way for us. The name of the lady was Anju Devi and she was looking
            pretty in her pink salwar kameez as hill women normally do.<img class="art-img left" src="/img/pinklady.jpeg" alt="Lady in Pink" /> The vehicle was terribly crowded. The driver was sitting in a space not more than 8 inches wide.
            He was driving with only his left hand. The floor gear was nearer to me than to him and I was sitting near the window on the opposite side. It is amazing how people devise ways and means of making money without regard for passenger safety.
            Under normal circumstances I would have declined to travel in such conditions but really had no choice in the matter. He drove skillfully though and negotiated twists and turns of the hilly road with utmost dexterity.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we thought our ordeal for the day was overcame another blow. There was one more landslide before Mangti. This appeared more dangerous and risky to cross than the previous one. The rain had meanwhile intensified. The Yatra Adhikari who was with us
            made inquiries from the people and after all round consultation with villagers and drivers of jeeps told me that we have no choice but to climb the steep face of the mountain in order to skirt the landslide. This was a difficult decision to
            take. We had ladies in our group and a few were not feeling well. But taking his advice for what it was worth, we started to climb the mountain by walking on a small and insignificant footpath that appeared to be used more by horses and ponies
            than by people. We had not eaten anything since breakfast and all of us were ravenously hungry.
        </p>
        <p>
            After we had climbed for over an hour, I realized the folly of what we had done. The guides did not know the route. A few villagers who were coming from opposite direction told us that the path was risky and ladies would find it difficult to carry on.
            There were ten ladies in the group and not all of them were young. They were my biggest worry. No less worrisome were some old men in the group. It was around 4 pm and the sun was beginning to go down and I did not want to get stranded on
            the slope of the mountain. So I decided to retrace our steps after the guide also suggested that it would be unwise to carry further like this. I contacted MEA on my Satellite phone and told them that I was stranded and could neither move
            forward nor backward.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was 4 pm when we all got down to the road once again. Tempers were running high because there was no assistance in sight and nobody had anything worthwhile to eat since morning. There was no point in consulting yatris as everybody had some opinion
            or the other that others did not approve of. I was waiting for a word from Yatra Adhikuari who had disappeared from the scene after making us climb the mountain. In this situation I sent a few yatris to go forward and find out what kind of
            landslide had halted our progress. Meanwhile I went on a reconnaissance mission to find out whether the ladies in our group could find some shelter for the night. There were only two huts in the neighbourhood. One was on the face of the mountain
            that we had just climbed and the other was just below the road towards the valley. Both were utterly insufficient to accommodate the yatris. In the midst of discussion with the yatris about our next course of action came the news from the
            drivers of the jeeps that were also stranded that the road to Pangla (a village 4 kms behind us that had good possibility of lodging and boarding) was clear. The drivers suggested to us that we all should move to Pangla and spend the night
            there. I talked to the drivers and packed yatris in jeeps. As we neared the village, the jeeps came to a halt. A fresh landslide had made even that village inaccessible. Now we were truly caught between the devil and the deep sea. This landslide
            was enormous and was the result of continuous rainfall. A huge rock had fallen and a 8-10 feet high mound of rock and other debris had collected at the place where once a road existed.
        </p>
        <p>
            We all got down and surveyed the scene. Crossing it when the landslide was fresh was full of risk. Everybody was looking up to me to deliver the judgment on what was to be done next. I never felt so helpless as I did then. Nor more responsible. I had
            to take care of 30 yatris and see that they perform safe yatra. After long rumination I decided to get back to the place from where we came. So we again went back to the place where we had climbed the mountain. The logic of this decision was
            that it was preferable to have a yatri who is sick than to have someone who is a cripple. Crossing the landslide carried the risk of a serious injury while sleeping in open could only make one sick at worst.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we were mulling our options in the fast fading light, Yatra Ahikari arrived. He appeared to have been informed by Delhi that we were stuck and that he should immediately go and rescue us. He had done his homework well. He informed me that there is
            no option at that stage but to go to Pangla where he had arranged two large halls for the night’s stay. He would also arrange a good dinner for us there. He had carried blankets with him in case we decide to take his advice.
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw his point. He had also come to this place after crossing the landslide. So there was the possibility of crossing it without hurting oneself. And frankly there was also the TINA factor. Then one had also to think about how could one survive the night
            in open and attend the morning constitutionals. Keeping all this in mind I decided to take his advice and head back to the landslide from where we had just come.
        </p>
        <p>
            We arrived at the landslide at 7 pm in the evening. We took out our torches and one by one crossed the landslide without any prime or collateral damage. All of us heaved a big sigh of relief and shouted in unison “Om Namah Shivay”. The village was about
            a couple of kilometers from the landslide. In the end we made it to the village and the newly constructed halls rented out for us at about 8 pm in the night. All of us collapsed on the floor as soon as durries were spread. Tea was served and
            biscuit packets opened. Candles lit and jokes cracked. There could not have been a more apt example of how quickly tempers become pleasant in a group bound together with a common objective and with its members dependent on one another for
            support, the moment the danger facing the group disappears. An hour ago there was heated debate on what should be done. I had to remind yatris that I was in charge and my decision would have to be respected. A few yatris had glared at me and
            some were visibly upset at how things had turned out. I could not blame them. They were tired and hungry. There was no place where they could lie down and rest. They were anxious about how they would spend the night and from where would the
            next meal come. All these apprehensions were not bothering them anymore. They were lying down no matter that it was some nondescript village in a nondescript setting. All that mattered to them was the prospect of spending peaceful night with
            their bellies full. And that was what lay in store for them. And that prospect dissolved all rancour that characterized group dynamics earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dinner was arranged in a small dhaba and served to us at 10.30 pm. A person came and kept a crate of 24 empty Pepsi bottles telling us that these bottles may be used in the morning for attending to the call of nature. By 11 pm all of us retired for the
            night in a much more comfortable physical and mental state of mind than had seemed possible a few hours ago.
