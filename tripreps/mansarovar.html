        <h3>Day 1: Sunday 22 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            The date for which I was waiting for such a long time since my selection as Liaison Office (LO) in April has at last arrived. I shall be meeting yatris today at Hearts and Lungs Hospital on Panchkuian Road Delhi. I had been applying for this post for
            the last several years and I was fifth time lucky this year. I felt that if Lord Shiva wants me to come to His abode in Mount Kailash (MK), He would make conditions propitious for my selection. I was clear in my mind that if I were ever to
            go to MK and ML it would be not because of my efforts but because of His inscrutable ways of getting things done in His own inimitable style. He also selects the time. I was certain that it was He who would make conditions favourable for my
            selection. It was His desire that I would be fulfilling if I were to be selected. Of course I would be doing all that was expected of me. Such as filling up form; getting for myself clearances and sanctions from government departments and
            appearing for interview in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).
        </p>
        <p>
            The sky was overcast. It had probably rained a little in the morning, as the dried droplets on cars seemed to suggest. I noticed them on my way to the neighbourhood park in the morning for my customary morning walk. Did some yoga and pranayama exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was on the way to the Hospital at about 10. I dressed casually to lend an air of informality to my interactions with yatris. Looked forward to meeting them. They would be my companions for the next one-month. They had agreed to place both their fate
            and faith in my hands on the advice and directive of Ministry of External Affairs that had selected me as pilgrims’ LO. A slew of questions crossed my mind. In what health would they be? What would be their fears and concerns? What kind of
            bonding would result as a result of this yatra? What could possibly be their age profile? I was going to be their LO and what did they expect from me? I had no clue to the answers of these questions at this stage. Will I ever have all the
            answers to the questions? I do not know.
        </p>
        <p>
            These thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of car at the hospital. As I entered the main gate I espied Mr. Joshi PRO (Public Relations Officer) of
            <a href="http://kmvn.in/ target=" blank ">Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd. (KMVN)</a> authoritatively sitting behind a desk arranged thoughtfully by the Hospital at a conspicuous place in the reception area meant for patients and their relatives. He was helping yatris generally and collecting their passports for getting group visa from the Chinese embassy. Mr. Joshi was dark, in early forties and had red teeth that suggested his addiction to that typically south Asian habit of chewing betel leaves. I had met him earlier and found him to be amiable. Mr. Joshi informed me that only 34 yatris have reported for medical examination. I was exultant. Smaller the group, better the management, I thought in my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then began a series of informal meeting with Yatris who were going about their business of getting themselves medically examined at different places in the hospital. All yatris could be identified by the red ribbon that had been pinned to their shirts or sarees. I was astonished to see a lean old man in white cotton shirt and dhoti with gray cropped hair walking briskly from one place to another. He appeared to be in either late sixties or early seventies. He was as straight as a ramrod and as lean as a reed. I made a mental note of this yatri as probably the oldest of the lot. A few yatris were sitting at a coffee counter chatting among themselves. When I walked up to them and introduced myself, a few were genuinely pleased while others were relieved. Don’t know why? A majority of Yatris appeared to be from Karnataka; from Bangalore and Mysore. It appeared to me that ladies were more than gents. But I was wrong in this assumption. Average age of Yatris? Around 45+. All of them were in the last stages of physical and mental preparation of yatra. I was glad that my batch was small and easy, so it seemed from whatever discussions I had with them. The purpose of my meeting them was to initially break the ice and get to know them better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Joshi in his typical officious manner asked whether I got my passport with me. Since I had not been advised to bring it with me, I could not give him one. He advised me to deliver it to Mr. Dalpati of MEA direct tomorrow by 11 so that action for obtaining group visa could be taken by him.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was getting close to noon when I left yatris to their devices and went home.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 2: Monday 23 July 2007</h3>
        <p>
            In the morning Mr. Dalpati called on my cell to inform me that he needed my passport urgently. I told him that I would come and give it to him by 11.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dropped in at MEA and handed over my passport to Dalpati. He asked me to collect the Satellite Phone in the afternoon. The man was pleasant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Went to Tigri Camp of Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) where Yatris were summoned for further medical examination. Those who were declared medically fit were obviously elated, while those who were not fit were disappointed. About 4-5 yatris were referred to Batra Hospital for a second opinion. Here I got further opportunity to mingle with the yatris. After the examination was over, all the yatris were called to the first floor hall, where lunch for them was arranged by a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO). We were given water, lemon juice and a well-organized lunch that included I think gulab jamuns. We were also given waist strap pouch containing Maggi soup powder, Nescafe pouches, and puja samagri. This was preceded by recitation of prayers to Lord Shiva. After one NGO had gone others came and gave yatris lectures on how to look after oneself during the yatra.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got bored with all this stuff and did a disappearing act. I was later informed that the NGOs had also given rations to the yatris for preparing food in China in four big sacks. Even a medical kit was given that contained, among essential medicines, a stethoscope and a BP instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I was leaving the Base Hospital a young man whom I did not recognize accosted me. He said that he would be leaving his old parents in my care during the yatra, and although he did not say it but from the way his eyes spoke, I understood that he wanted some words of assurance from me that they would be looked after well. I made some reassuring noises that seemed to satisfy him. It was then that I realized the enormity of responsibility that I had assumed and felt terribly humbled.
