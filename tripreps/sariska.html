        <h2 class="centered">Bird Watching Trip to Sariska</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The prospect of not doing anything worthwhile during the recent run of holidays that overshadowed the weekend was foreboding. So a few birders decided to stitch together a getaway that could take us away from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi"
                target="_blank">Delhi</a>. The attraction of not-so-far-away dry countryside of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sariska_Tiger_Reserve" target="_blank">Sariska</a>, sans tiger, proved compelling and decisive.
        </p>
        <h3>The journey</h3>
        <p>
            So on a partly cloudy afternoon of Saturday we three birders – N Shivakumar and Sharad Khanna being the other two – drove to Sariska. The weather was tolerable but not the traffic. As soon as we reached the toll plaza beyond the Hero Honda chowk, we found
            ourselves truly surrounded by an ocean of all kinds of motorized vehicles. For at least a mile on either side of the toll plaza on the side of expressway going towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur " target="_blank ">Jaipur</a>,
            all we could see was an ocean of vehicles of all hues and shapes. What created that traffic snarl was not important. That was a fact and we had to deal with it there and then. The traffic police and the managers of toll plaza had made themselves
            scarce. Moving even an inch proved difficult. Under such circumstances the driving skills and survival instincts of our Etah born driver, who was earlier working in a call center, proved heaven-sent. He literally transformed our vehicle into
            a serpent that winded its way out of the mess. He then made a u-turn just before the toll plaza and drove towards the road that takes us to Sultanpur bird sanctuary. We left behind the rice mill where we take the right turn for Sultanpur.
            Finally, after many stoppages for seeking direction from obliging locals, we hit the main expressway near IMT chowk about an hour later than we otherwise would have had the snarl not delayed us. The drive thereafter was a breeze.
        </p>
        <p>
            En route we stopped at a milestone that showed Alwar 18 kilometers to check whether the tree favoured by a pair of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_grey_hornbill " target="_blank ">Indian Grey Hornbill</a> on our last visit four
            years ago – in May 2004 - for building its nest, is still their prime favourite. We neither saw any Hornbill nor the nest and the tree in which it was built.
        </p>
        <p>We reached Sariska a little after dusk without further ado and prepared ourselves for the next day's outing.</p>
        <h3>Day1: Sunday 13 April 2008 (Forenoon)</h3>
        <p>
            The first difference that we felt after getting up in the morning was the quality of air we breathed. It was pure air. Well almost as pure as you can get. The difference was sentient. The pollution in Delhi benumbs our senses. A short walk from the Forest
            Guest House revealed that spotted doves were as common there as perhaps house sparrows. We left the guest house at 6:30am to get inside the park along with Sh. Sri Chand a Forest Guard and a very keen birder</p>
        <p>
            Sariska and its surrounding areas had seen light rains during the last few weeks. This had enabled "Dhok " or "Dhau " (Anogeissus Pendula) trees to grow little green shoots of leaves off their bare branches. The hills that are full of this typical Aravali
            species of tree looked like they were awash in light pastel green watercolour. Hingot trees were laden with fruit and so were kareel bushes on which were feeding red-vented bulbuls and chestnut shouldered petronia.</p>
        <p>
            On way to Kalighati we saw a mangy jackal that was feeding on human excreta. It was tragic. In Sariska sanctuary grey francolins are very confiding and allow very close approach unlike those in Sultanpur where they fly off at the slightest hint of humans
            within a radius of 20 feet. So my two friends had great time shooting them.</p>
        <p>
            After we had crossed Governor's road in the sanctuary we saw a long-billed vulture soaring high up in the sky. Keeping him company was a short-toed snake eagle. In between the handling of my Inskipp book and the binocular I forgot to take back the book
            that I had kept on top of the car. The result? The book apparently fell off the car after we drove away from that place. And so I lost a companion that had kept me company and taught me so much during innumerable field trips in and around
            Delhi. Frantic search after the loss was discovered did not help
        </p>
        <h3>Day1: Sunday 13 April 2008 (Afternoon)</h3>
        <p>
            The afternoon session was productive for two reasons. One was that we saw a leopard in the wild and the other was the clear view that a party of 7 Jungle Bush Quails gave us minutes before we followed the alarm calls of a sambhar and a monkey. Our driver,
            one CL Meena, instantly knew the location of the alarm calls and sped towards the hill not far from Kalighati. The alarm calls were persistent and we all craned our necks to catch the glimpse of one of the most elusive cats of the Indian jungle.
            I had read much about alarm calls of these denizens of our forests in the books of Ken Anderson and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Corbett" target="_blank">Jim Corbett</a>. But it was for the first time that I was hearing
            them for as long as half an hour. I can tell you that it makes your hair stand on end even when you know that you are safe. Silence is only broken by these calls and the sound of your heavy breathing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then our driver spotted the leopard ( a full grown adult ) lying down on a sloping hill about 200 feet from us. Its white spotted belly was pointing towards us. A couple of peacocks were strutting nonchalantly only a few feet away from him. When we moved
            closer to him to have a better look it had disappeared from view. The alarm calls continued. We then saw a male sambhar calling and walking in the direction of the leopard's movement. Meena informed us that sambhars usually do that. They follow
            predators while bellowing alarm calls. After some 5 minutes Meena sighted the leopard walking towards a waterhole about 500 meters towards our left. I tried to see but could not see anything. It was only after Meena had almost exhausted all
            his patience in pointing to us the location of the leopard that we could see him. It was a magnificent adult leopard who perhaps wanted to be left alone and was being disturbed by a bunch of overenthusiastic tourists. Soon thereafter it disappeared
            from sight behind the hill on the opposite side.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 2: Monday 14 April 2008</h3>
        <p>
            The morning was chilly. We headed for Pandupole on our last day of birding. The landscape is just as lovely as it was four years ago although the bird population and its variety has fallen a bit. At this time of the year red-vented bulbul and chestnut
            shouldered petronia were most numerous. This session of birding proved lucky for sighting of raptors. Apart from the usual black-shouldered kite and shikra we saw oriental honey buzzard, white eyed buzzard, white-rumped vulture and perhaps
            booted eagle. I am not sure about the last one as it was very high up in the air. The call of the white eye buzzard was mesmerizing (ti-tiuuuu). We also saw a large woodshrike high up on a tree next to the temple.
        </p>
        <p>In all we saw approximately 70 species of birds at this time of the year. Not too bad, eh?</p>
        <p>
            We left the place at 1 pm to arrive in Delhi by 6 pm in the evening. This time there was not a hint of traffic jam and we had a smooth ride although I feel that the expressway is anything but that given the number of cyclists, motorcyclists and jaywalkers
            threatening to derail the fast traffic at any time.
        </p>
