            <h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
            <img class="medimg left " src="/img/dilippandit.jpeg " alt="Picture of Dilip Pandit " />
            <p>Hmm... What do I write in my homepage? That is a question that needs to be answered as an introduction to the curious web surfer. In fact, a more pertinent question would be why should anyone read this page or surf the website. That is a more
                appropriate question to ask of me.
            </p>
            <p>Now I am more comfortable answering that question.</p>
            <p>To begin with I must confess that this website has come <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(novel) " target="_blank ">after the “world conspired to make it happen” - to paraphrase Paul Coelho</a>. Had it not been for the
                generous offer of <a href="https://www.dharwadkar.com " target="_blank ">Mukul Dharwadkar</a>, my nephew based in San Francisco, to design, launch and maintain this website, I don’t think you would be reading this page. So, a big clap
                and thank you to Mukul.</p>
            <h2>Watching birds and nature</h2>
            <p>Moreover, I have been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdwatching " target="_blank ">birdwatcher</a> and a nature lover. And this passion has taken me wherever there are birds to be seen and photographed. Over the last two decades
                I have travelled all over India and visited a few foreign countries. Since birds can be seen everywhere, I have, over the years, developed a huge collection of bird photographs from every corner of India and outside. Besides photographing
                birds and landscape, I also have been interested in, and seen, places of historical and cultural importance that few tourists prefer to go to. Right in the interiors of villages and cities.</p>
            <p>Besides, whenever I shared photographs of birds or monuments with my friends and well-wishers on WhatsApp group they would suggest that I create an online collection of my album that can be accessed by the world at large 24 X 7. This small
                attempt on my part is dedicated to them in general and to you dear visitor in particular. I do sincerely hope that it meets with your approval.</p>
            <p>I should therefore like to think that anyone who has an iota of interest in Nature, or India for that matter, may find something useful in the pages of this website. No one would be happier than I if even one person, at the end of the day,
                finds it even remotely interesting or useful. That would be my reward for the painstaking work I have done all these years in putting together stories and trip reports and photographs.</p>
            <h2>Wanderlust</h2>
            <p>Visiting places of interest is of little value because one tends to forget what one has seen a few weeks later. So what helps one to remember? Diary. Right? And photographs to go with it.</p>

            <p>I have been keeping a daily journal since 2008. That allows me to rewind and relive the events that I have witnessed and these notes stand me in good stead whenever I have to write, years later, about events or functions that I attended in
                all these years.</p>
            <h2>Civil Service days</h2>
            <p>I retired from <a href="https://www.upsc.gov.in/ " target="_blank ">Civil Service of India</a> in 2014. I was posted in Arunachal Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Delhi and have travelled all over India in personal and official capacity.
                That allowed me unique opportunity to soak in the different and, I dare say, mind boggling varied flavours of India – historical, religious, cultural and ecological. And I can assure you that even an Indian gets amazed by the sheer diversity
                of India.</p>
            <h2>Onward to North-East</h2>
            <p>During my stint in Arunachal Pradesh I travelled all over North Eastern states and saw National Parks and Sanctuaries notified in these seven sister states. At least most of them if not all. It is for this reason that one link is devoted to
                <a href="/necorner/index.html">North-East</a> in the north-east corner of the website. There is so much diversity in these North Eastern region of India that an Indian travelling to, and in, these states feels completely alien in their
                midst.
            </p>
            <h2>Stints as Election Observer</h2>
            <p>I have also been fortunate to be posted as General Observer during Parliamentary and Assembly Elections held in States of India. During this time, one spends a month in the constituency to which one is posted to ensure free and fair elections
                This opportunity allowed me to see the culture of the states at close quarters and of course their bio-diversity. You may find a link devoted to the travel in these states.</p>
            <h2>Thank you!</h2>
            <p>Hope you will find the visit to the website useful and informative. Should you have any query related to any topic covered in the website you may contact me using the <a href="/contactus.html ">Contact Us</a> page here. I shall be happy to
                answer your query as best as I can.</p>
            <p>
                Finally, I would like to thank my wife Suchita and Children Aditi and Ameya who encouraged me to take to writing seriously and share it with others for whatever it is worth. A big THANK YOU to them as well.
            </p>
            <p>This website in a work in progress. It will surely evolve as new ideas germinate, take hold and become available as new content for the website.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile wish you Happy Surfing.</p>
