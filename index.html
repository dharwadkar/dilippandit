            <p>Hmm... What do I write in my homepage? That is a question that needs to be answered sincerely. In fact, a more pertinent question would be why should anyone read this page or surf the website. That is a more appropriate question to ask of
                me.
            </p>
            <p>Now I am more comfortable answering that question.</p>
            <p>To begin with I must confess that this website has come after the “world conspired to make it happen” - to paraphrase Paul Coelho. Had it not been for the generous offer of <a href="https://www.dharwadkar.com" target="_blank">Mr. Mukul Dharwadkar</a>,
                my nephew based in San Francisco, to design, launch and maintain this website, I don’t think you would be reading this page. So, a big clap and thank you to Mukul.</p>

            <p>Moreover, I have been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdwatching" target="_blank">birdwatcher</a> and a nature lover. And this passion has taken me wherever there are birds to be seen and photographed. Over the last two decades
                I have travelled all over India and visited a few foreign countries. Since birds can be seen everywhere, I have, over the years, developed huge collection of bird photographs from every corner of India and outside. Besides photographing
                birds and landscape, I also have been interested in, and seen, places of historical and cultural importance that few tourists prefer to go to. Right in the interiors of villages and cities.</p>

            <p>Visiting places of interest is of little value because one tends to forget what one has seen a few weeks later. So what helps one to remember? Diary. Right? And photographs to go with it.</p>

            <p>I have been keeping a daily journal since 2008. That allows me to rewind and relive the events that I have witnessed and these notes stand me in good stead whenever I have to write, years later, about events or functions that I attended in
                all these years.</p>

            <p>I retired from <a href="https://www.upsc.gov.in/" target="_blank">Civil Service of India</a> in 2014. I was posted in Arunachal Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Delhi and have travelled all over India in personal and official capacity.
                That allowed me unique opportunity to soak in the different flavours of India – historical, religious, cultural and ecological. And I can assure you that even an Indian gets amazed by the sheer diversity of India.</p>

            <p>During my stint in Arunachal Pradesh I travelled all over North Eastern states and seen National Parks and Sanctuaries notified in these seven sister states. It is for this reason that one link is devoted to <a href="/necorner/index/html">North-East</a>.
                There is so much diversity in these North Eastern region of India that an Indian travelling to, and in, these states feels completely alien in their midst.</p>

            <p>I have also been fortunate to be posted as General Observer during Parliamentary and Assembly Elections held in States of India. During this time one spends a month in the constituency to which one is posted to ensure free and fair elections
                This opportunity allowed me to see the culture of the states at close quarters and of course their bio-diversity. You may find a link devoted to the travel in these states.</p>

            <p>Hope you will find the visit to the website useful and informative. Should you have any query related to any topic covered in the website you may contact me using the <a href="/contactus.html">Contact Us</a> page here. I shall be happy to
                answer your query as best as I can.</p>
            <p>This website in a work in progress. It will surely evolve as new ideas generate and new content is available. Meanwhile wish you Happy Surfing.</p>
