            The following account is from my journal dated 8 April 2011. On that day I was in Tiruvannamalai in Tamilnadu for election duty as <a href="https://eci.gov.in/" target="_blank">ECI (Election Commision of India)</a> General Head Observer.
        </p>
        <p>
            We observers, about 7 in all, stayed in the Circuit House where the Collector had arranged a local lady to show her collections of silk sarees for sale from a nearby silk saree making unit. That unit reportedly supplied sarees to Nalli Store.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is what I observed when the lady came to my room and other observers came to see the sarees to select and buy for their wives. 
        </p>
        <h3>Quote</h3>
        <p>
            Yesterday Salvi the sareewali had come at 4 pm. I had called all observers to check if they wished to buy sarees. How these men select sarees gives an idea of what kind of men they are and what kind of relationship do they have with their wives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Nawaz came. He said that he doesn’t know much about sarees and started to look for ones that appealed to his fancy. Just checked with me and others to see if his selections are okay. He asked Selvi the length of the saree twice just to confirm that he had heard the size correctly the first time. Not that he would have known the standard size of a saree. These two sarees cost him Rs.6800. He said that he didn’t have money with him and asked her to collect it from him tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
            From this I inferred that Mr Nawaz wasn’t in the least worried about whether his wife would like these sarees or not. Which in turn shows that his wife could be docile and accepts meekly whatever he gives her. He could spend Rs.6800/- without much thought either about make or quality. So he is not a very discerning buyer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr Wadhawan, another EO, casually walked in and gave a hard and long look at the sarees and picked one that I thought was the best among them. If I had to pick up I would have picked that one. He got it opened, took it outside, made sure that it is alright from all angles and bought it. Again no hard bargaining. This shows that Mr. Wadhawan is clear in his mind what he wants to buy and doesn’t waste much time in buying it. I also felt that he is confident that his wife would like what he buys so there was no hesitation nor any phone calls to check out whether the colour was okay.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Venkateswara Rao was the last one to arrive. Made thorough enquiries, checked all sarees, made phone calls to his wife to check whether the color of the sarees he had shortlisted were alright by her. He also aggressively told the saleswoman to reduce the price and give hefty discount. He knew in short “The Art of buying sarees”. He must have made these people open up all the sarees, asked all kinds of questions and asked me why I am not buying any sarees and what are the latest trends and designs. He is every woman’s ideal of how husband should conduct himself while buying sarees alone. A perfect study of these different men buying sarees for their wives. I was watching intently these men and was both amused and intrigued by how these men make decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for me I just avoid buying sarees in the absence of Suchita. It is better to spend more shopping with her than to hear complaints about colour, design, trend and price specially when it is practically impossible to return a saree once bought.
        </p>
        <h3>Unquote</h3>
        <p>
            “But you said yesterday that only self attested copies would do. You didn’t tell me yesterday to bring originals with me for verification.” I replied. By this time the heat and her haughty behaviour was beginning to take a toll on my patience.
        </p>
        <p>
            PS: Just to elaborate. Mr Nawaz was from Income tax as Expenditure Observer. Mr Wadhawan was an IAS officer from Punjab and Mr Rao DIG Police observer from MP.
