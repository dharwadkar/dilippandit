        <h2 class="centered">A Diabolical Cross Connection</h2>
        <p>
            In an age when a ubiquitous cell phone had not become a reality and when landline phones were used frequently, cross-connections did take place on rare occasions. This happened when one call is rudely interrupted by another call and a new voice seeks
            your urgent attention. I experienced one such cross- connection sometime during late nineties when I worked in the the erstwhile Delhi Vidyut Board as its Secretary. This call led to quite bizarre and unexpected development as the following
            true story will illustrate.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hello what did you say? Wait I think there is cross connection. Someone else is trying to speak to me. Could you please hang up for a minute. Let me see who is at the other end." I told my friend to whom I was talking when suddenly out of the blue another
            voice interrupted my existing call and insisted on talking to me.
        </p>
        <p>My friend hung up as advised. And then the person at the other end came clearly on the line.</p>
        <p>
            “Who are you?” He asked me.<br> "Who do you wish to speak with?"" I asked in return. I get quite irritated with people who ring up and ask you your name without confirming the number they have dialled.<br> "I am Surendra Gupta from Chandni
            Chowk" he replied and enquired whether his friend one Mr. Rohit Sharma was on the line<br> "I think you should check the number you have dialled". I told him as I prepared to put down the receiver.<br> "Just wait. Who are you anyway?"" He
            insisted on asking my name.<br> "Well if you insist I am Dilip Pandit".
        </p>
        <p>
            This is how our initial conversation started. He asked me what I do and told me what he does. It seems that he was in some kind of printing business in Chandni Chowk. When he came to know that I was working for Delhi Vidyut Board as Secretary he tried
            to be a little friendly. He also told me that he is an Astrologer and makes birth chart of people as a side business. He offered to make one for me and my children if I could give him their date, place and time of birth.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was not too keen on taking this conversation forward with someone whom I had not yet personally met. However I thought there should be no problem in sharing details of birth date with someone just to see if he is serious about what he says he does.
            I was stupid. He had a way of making people believe him. A perfect con man.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sure enough he sent a huge packet containing print outs of birth chart and details of all astrological charts of my family sans my wife a few weeks later. He appeared to be genuine so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then started what I, in retrospect, thought was an elaborate attempt at influencing me in playing his diabolical game. He told me that if I do as he bid me to do I shall gain in power and money. I do not know what happened to me. I started believing what
            he said on phone without yet meeting him. If I were to describe what he tried to do with me now, twenty years later, it will surely be called as trying to hypnotise a potential victim. The matters came to a head when his call came about a
            month after we spoke for the first time thanks to a cross-connection on an MTNL (Mahanagar Telecom Nigam Limited) line.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Mr Pandit, I tell you to go to Rama Vihar where you will find a half finished building that I am constructing. I will give you exact address when you decide to go. When you enter the building take a right turn and enter a room and urinate on the southern
            wall of the room." If that sounds like an idiotic and stupid way to describe this conversation then I don’t blame you. But this is what precisely he said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Look I don’t have time to do this. And frankly I don’t think we should take this forward anymore" I tried to tell him as calmly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            "But you don’t understand Pandit sahab. I promise you would not regret doing this. Many of my friends have benefitted enormously by doing this." He sounded slightly irritated at having been told where to get off.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I will let you know what I intend to do in a few days’ time." I said just to buy time and and get rid of him on phone without sounding impolite.
        </p>
        <p>
            My wife was near me overhearing our conversation. She was quite perplexed at the long rope I seem to be giving him. I too felt that this fellow, who I have never met is trying to cast a spell on me. Yet I felt helpless.
        </p>
        <p>
            When his phone came the following day to ask what I intended to do I had made up my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Look Mr. Gupta, I am fed up of your calls and I am not doing anything that you have suggested to me. Either you stop bothering me or I shall report the matter to the Police." I said sternly and at the same time feeling relieved at the finality of my
            decision that I conveyed to him in no uncertain terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that he never rang up.
        </p>
        <p>
            But a few weeks later I read in the paper that his printing press has been raided by the anti-theft squad of Delhi Vidyut Board for theft and that his printing press been slapped a bill of Rs. 10 lacs. When I checked up with my staff it appeared that
            he was using an unauthorised 3-phase 11A KW connection without meter for quite sometime. A rascal indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was how the story of the initial diabolical cross connection ended.
