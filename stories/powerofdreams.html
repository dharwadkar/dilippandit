        <h2 class="centered">The Power of Dreams</h2>
        <p>
            This story which I am going to narrate to you is a true, albeit old, story and I can vouch for its correctness though a few details might be lost due to ravages of time. It is about as old as my entry into professional life.
        </p>
        <p>
            It begins at the time when I shared a room with a friend while working for a private company. We were not chums but shared an occasional insight into what constitutes life and what turn it could suddenly take to make us either a victim of circumstances
            or its hero.
        </p>
        <p>
            He told me that his friend was doing well in life when he suddenly resigned from his job and left for his hometown. My friend at that time shared a room with him before finding me as a new room mate.
        </p>
        <p>
            “One day he came to the room and told me that he has resigned and is leaving for his home in Kota where he plans to stay and prepare for IAS exams”. My friend informed me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had met his friend a few times and shared an occasional chat. He didn’t strike me as a particularly bright young man although I could be wrong. He came from a typical middle class family that, though not very rich, wasn’t too poor to support him without
            a job. His name was Ramesh Singh.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Did you try to find out why he suddenly resigned. Was he doing well at work?" I tried to ask my friend just to make sure that Ramesh wasn’t depressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No yaar he was fine. He was doing well at work though the kind of job he did wasn’t to his liking."
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn’t pursue the matter as I thought I had no business to poke my nose in someone else’s affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
            A couple of years passed since we had this conversation. Then one day as we sat down in our room having our dinner after a hard day at work, the telephone rang and my friend got up to pick it up.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hello"
        </p>
        <p>"Wow that is fantastic. Congratulations. When is the party?"</p>
        <p>
            "Okay, I will talk to you later. Enjoy your success and pay my regards to your parents" said my friend as he hung up the phone.
        </p>
        <p>
            My friend came and sat down to finish his dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You know Ramesh. Don’t you?" He asked. "He managed to get into IAS. Isn’t that exciting?"
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried hard to recollect who he was talking about but then it struck me.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yeah I do. That guy who suddenly resigned and left for his hometown. Am happy for him."
        </p>
        <p>
            My friend finished his dinner, lit up a cigarette and blew out rings of smoke into the stuffy room.. He suddenly became reflective.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you believe in the power of dreams?" He asked suddenly without looking at me.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What did you say" I was taken aback at the sudden turn the conversation took.
        </p>
        <p>
            "The power of dreams Dilip. We all dream but don’t have the courage to pursue them and turn them to reality. But Ramesh did" My friend continued as if he was talking to himself. Then he suddenly woke up from his reverie and told me the following account
            of his meeting with Ramesh a few months back when the two friends met.
        </p>
        <p>
            It appears that one night Ramesh had a dream that his cousin had appeared in Civil Services exams and managed to crack it. When he woke up he was upset. He could not stomach the idea that his cousin could steal a march over him. So in a fit of impulsive
            behaviour he decided to best her by resigning from the job and trying to get into IAS as his cousin had done in his dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Most of us would have dismissed Ramesh’s dream as just that - a dream. Wouldn’t we? But not Ramesh. He took it as a challenge at a considerable risk to his career. He had to slog it out for two years and listen to derisive comments from those who didn’t
            believe he had in him what it takes to succeed in these tough exams."
        </p>
        <p>
            By this time I too was intrigued by this revelation. Who takes dreams seriously? I thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Wasn’t this a foolish thing to do? I mean waking up one fine morning and deciding to put in one’s paper just because one had a dream that one’s cousin has done better than oneself." I asked incredulously.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes I too thought so but then when I realised that he was serious and preparing sincerely for exams I supported him. Mind you he was lucky to get support from his family without which he couldn’t have achieved this. He took a sabbatical for a couple
            of years just to prepare for exams."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You know what is our problem?" My friend asked me absentmindedly, jabbing me with a pointed question.
        </p>
        <p>
            "We don’t pursue our dreams which we dream with our eyes open and mind fully functional. And Ramesh took risks when he dreamt his dream with both his faculties at rest during his sleep. We just don’t take any risk and let the humdrum existence of our
            life get the better of us. Ramesh took enormous risk to realise his dream of not being second best even if it meant a spurious competition with his cousin that in reality didn’t exist but made him a better human being"
        </p>
        <p>
            My friend answered his own rhetorical question without waiting for an answer from me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I just nodded and got up to pick up our plates to put them in the sink of our kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
            He had made a profound observation that stayed with me ever since.
