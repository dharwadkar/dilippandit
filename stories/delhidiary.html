        <h2 class="centered">Delhi – Then and Now</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p> I have lived in Delhi for over 25 years - my most productive years of life. I came to the city as a stranger in early dawn of eighties for earning my livelihood. In a few months I shall leave the city for a few years to work in another state.
            How does it feel to leave the city, which for all practical purposes is now my home?</p>
        <h3>Nostalgia</h3>
        <p>The Delhi of eighties is not the Delhi of the new millennium. It has changed beyond recognition. That is obvious. But for those who are in their twenties, I would like to list out a few prominent changes that have occurred. I have to strain my
            memory to count the number of flyovers the city had 25 years ago. Now I have lost count. Either one had to wait for a couple of years before one could buy a Bajaj scooter from the company or one had to pay premium to buy it from someone else.
            Now the car and the scooter – oops! motorbike - companies vie with one another to woo customers with baits of gifts and discounts. In telecommunication space, MTNL reigned supreme. It made the business of granting telephone connection an elaborate
            ritual in which it played the role of a high priest. Cars were decidedly fewer and DTC bus service not as much maligned as it is now. Road accidents were fewer and the word ‘road rage’ had not established itself in popular lexicon till a few
            years ago. BRT? What? Say that again. Travel by underground metro was a distant dream.</p>
        <h3>Progress?</h3>
        <p>Good that Delhi has grown. But has it grown for the better? I do not know.</p>
        <p>There was a time when the price of mother dairy milk was considered to be sacrosanct. Public outrage was deafening whenever the price of milk was raised. Now one hardly notices any increase in the price of milk. Mother Dairy does it with practiced
            ease every now and then. Did you notice that Mother Dairy raised the price of milk a few days back?</p>
        <p>There was only one TV channel that we saw. Doordarshan. The first popular serial was “Hum Log” on telly whose each episode was preceded by comments from Dadamuni. Power and water shortage were not as quite common as they are now. My tenflat had
            round the clock water supply till 1986.</p>
        <h3>Parting thoughts</h3>
        <p>What I did for the city that has given me so much, you might well ask. Not much really. But I am really proud of adding to the green cover of Delhi. I personally planted seven trees in 1991 around my flat on the occasion of the first birthday
            of my son. All of them but one survive. Their branches overhang the terrance of my flat. Two of these provide regular supply of fruits every year in the months of April and June. Mulberry and Rai Jamun.</p>

        <p>I shall miss these trees and their fruits the most when I leave the city.</p>
