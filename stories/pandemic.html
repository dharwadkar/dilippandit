        <h2 class="centered">When opportunity knocks on door</h2>
        <p>
            I narrate this true story to suggest that one is at times truly amazed by strange coincidences that seem to suggest inscrutable ways in which you are helped by an unknown force.
        </p>
        <p>A couple of years ago I got a call from my colleague who worked as CMD of a public sector company.</p>
        <p>
            “Hi Pandit how are you doing? Long time no see!” He greeted amiably after his PS connected me to his landline. I knew that he must have rung up for some purpose because he wasn’t particularly close to me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “Life couldn’t be better. God has been kind. How are you?” I replied a little apprehensive of what to expect next.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Are you doing something to engage yourself meaningfully after retirement?” he probed tentatively after initial pleasantries were over.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well I do a bit of birdwatching and the government has given me some part time work that keeps me mentally occupied”. I replied certain by now that something was the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Would you like to work as an Arbitrator? The Arbitrators we have engaged are doing a shoddy job and giving awards arbitrarily and the company is paying enormous price for their terrible piece of work”
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I have never worked as an Arbitrator in arbitration cases which is a special subject in law. Although I am a qualified lawyer, I have absolutely no knowledge of practical aspects of conducting Arbitration cases. I sensed that this is an opportunity knocking on the door to learn something new. Earn while you learn kind of a practical course. Besides, if I couldn’t cope up with the pressure of working as an Arbitrator I could always quit.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Why not? But I must tell you I have not worked as an Arbitrator before although I was on a panel of <a href="https://nhai.gov.in/" target=_blank">NHAI (National Highways Authority of India)</a> for three years.” I replied
        </p>
        <p>
            “‘That is fine. Just apply for empanelment in our company with your CV. I will send someone to collect the application tomorrow.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Thanks. Will keep the application ready.” I said as I hung up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next day his man came and collected my application. I must mention here that before this day I hadn’t even read the Arbitration and Conciliation Act under which arbitration proceedings are held although I had worked as a District and Sessions Judge in Arunachal Pradesh where at that time Executive and Judiciary hadn’t been separated for historical reasons. So it was a leap in the dark with a lot of hard work to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well he was as true as his word. A few weeks later not only I was empaneled but a case was assigned to me which appeared to be very complicated. I started the proceedings. The counsel for the Claimants was a wily old man who worked in the company of my colleague before retiring and made it his business to appear as a counsel for contractors working for the company. In short an unscrupulous fellow. It is said that if one wishes to learn a new subject one must work with such fellows who use every trick in the trade to gain undue advantage over their opponents sometime even by lying before the Arbitrator as he did before me with a deadpan face. Thereafter I was on guard whenever I dealt with him. Since I was new, he started quoting chapter and verse of the law of Arbitration in pleadings and proceedings. I necessarily had to burn midnight oil to understand the subject, read case laws and decide on the merits of his arguments. I didn’t even know the ABC of how to write an Award or how to conduct proceedings. I spoke to a few of my senior colleagues who did help me. But theory and practice are quite different. I couldn’t have consulted my friends for every decision I had to make on the spot. I had no option but to draw upon my experience of applying basic knowledge of law during my working life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then came what I feel in retrospect was the Divine intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was given another case by my colleague that was a very simple case. The case file had a copy of the Award announced by the previous Arbitrator - who happened to be a retired DG of <a href="https://cpwd.gov.in/" target="_blank">CPWD (Central Public Works Department)</a>. In short, the kind of experienced man whose Award was a model award for me. Besides, his award was challenged by the parties in the High Court and the judgement of the High Court formed part of the case file. These documents were like god sent to me. I instantly knew how to appraise evidence, write an Award and conduct proceedings. I couldn’t have asked for a better teacher. The judgment of the High Court taught me how High Courts decide appeals against the Award announced by the Arbitrator. This was a case that was heard before and so all these documents were sent to me. This does not happen when a fresh case is assigned. This case was assigned to me because the Arbitrator who was given the case initially after the High Court of Delhi set aside a small part of the award of DG CPWD, sadly died in the first COVID wave. One could discern a pattern here of strange coincidences. The officer who died was the retired Chief Secretary of a State.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I read the case file of the second case I felt much at ease and more confident of conducting the proceedings in the first case.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the best part was that the fee that was payable in the second case - a much simpler case - was more or less equal to the first case.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now what do you make of that? I see it as a Divine Intervention to help me with Arbitration cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was another experience when I accepted a challenging assignment but dropped out after sometime. More about that story some other time.
