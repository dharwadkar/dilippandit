        <h2 class="centered">A life lesson from Pandemic</h2>
        <p>
            I first saw him looking down at the box full of mangoes that looked healthy and enticing. He was an old man in his late sixties, with short grey hair covering his temples. He had a bald pate and broad forehead. His fair skin hung a bit loosely under his throat and wrinkles on his hands gave an unmistakable evidence of an advancing age. He was about five eight and might have weighed 65 kgs.
        </p>
        <p>
            He stood for a long time looking at the box that lay on the ground in a departmental store. I was buying items from the shelf near him and was observing him from the corner of my eye. I thought he needed help.</p>
        <p>
            “Good morning Sir. These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaunsa" target="_blank">Chaunsa mangoes”</a>. I offered information about the mangoes in order to start a conversation to find out why he stood staring at the mangoes for almost 5 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes I can see that. But don’t you think these are a lot more expensive than what you could get from a man selling them on a hand cart”. He answered pleasantly pointing to the slip on the box that indicated the price of the mangoes at ₹290/kg. His voice was clear and he spoke with the confidence of a man who knew what he was talking about. He wore a fawn coloured trouser and a sort of a loose fitting light blue Lacoste T-shirt, giving me the impression that he must have lost weight recently.
        </p>
        <p>
            “You are right Sir. At 290 a kg these are certainly more than double the rate at which you can get them from outside. But these are big mangoes and appear to be very good. The ones that you can get from outside are not half as good or big.”
        </p>
        <p>
            By this time the attendant from the Store had arrived to help him.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Do you need these mangoes? The mango season is about to end and you might not get these till next year. We might not even be able to get fresh boxes after this box is sold out.” The attendant tried the usual trick to make him buy it.
        </p>
        <p>
            “He is right Mr….”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Khanna. I am DP Khanna.” He extended his hand with a smile and shook my hand firmly.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes, the mango season is almost at an end. If you like them you could consider buying them”. I was surprised at my unusual eagerness to push him to buy them.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Okay if you say so.” He bent down and selected 7 best mangoes from the box that weighed 2.5 kgs.” The attendant took the mangoes, put them in a plastic bag, weighed them on an electronic scale and handed him a slip for payment at the cash counter.
        </p>
        <p>
            By this time, I too had finished shopping and we both made our way through the narrow aisle to the cash counter and stood in the long queue.
        </p>
        <p>
            “You know what clinched the issue for me?” He asked me with a friendly smile.
        </p>
        <p>
            “You see I was brought up in a family where my mother saved every penny even if that meant haggling with vendors till they lowered the price. I would accompany my mother as a little boy on our weekly rounds of the vegetable and fruit markets. It was during these weekly rounds that I as a teenager learnt the Indian way of buying vegetables and fruits from roadside vendors. I observed my mother closely and learnt how to differentiate good from bad, fresh from stale and tender from overripe vegetables.” He apparently wished to tell me why he stood there a long time staring at the box.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Having learnt from my mother the virtues of parsimonious and frugal living I just couldn’t bring myself to buy those mangoes at such an exorbitant rate even though I knew I could easily afford them. I was torn between my frugal and simple upbringing where every penny mattered and my current status as a member of a well-to-do family. Buy or not to buy that was the question I was struggling with when I stood near the box for so long. One part of me said since you can afford, go ahead and buy them. While the other part said why waste your money just because you have it and can afford to buy mangoes”. He said with a confiding smile that endeared him to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I hope I haven’t influenced your decision to buy those mangoes.” I said feeling sorry that I might have just made him pay more than he wanted to.
        </p>
        <p>
            “No No. Don’t be sorry. You helped me in deciding the right course of action.” By this time, we had paid our bill at the counter and had come out of the store.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Do you know why I bought the mangoes?” He asked me rather abruptly while walking together in the corridor of the market.
        </p>
        <p>
            “My wife and I suffered from COVID during the pandemic. We were very close to death. Fortunately, by God’s grace we survived. I have never been so close to death in my life. It was then that I realised that we need to relearn the art of living whatever remains of our short life now. My mother’s lessons stood me in good stead thus far and are still valuable. But then one must decide whether those lessons hold good for all times. Don’t you agree? Who knows I may not survive next year and lose the opportunity to eat good mangoes this season? What good is the money that remains in the bank account after I am gone if I cannot relish one fruit that I enjoy most, here and now. So, when you prodded me to buy them my mind was made up. Thank you Mr...”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Pandit. Dilip Pandit” I said as we parted company at the next bend.
