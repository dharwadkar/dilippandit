        <h2 class="centered">An officer and his orderly</h2>
        <p>
            This true story was narrated to me by a retired friend who worked in ITBP as a doctor. I recount the story only to show infinite goodness of human nature that manifests itself from time to time in all of us. The story is about being helpful, grateful,
            generous, kind and empathetic towards another human being.
        </p>
        <p>
            My friend was posted as a doctor in Kulu during the late sixties when his boss who was a DIG (Deputy Inspector General of Police) visited the hill station on a routine inspection of the battalion stationed there. My friend who was a bachelor at that time
            had casually confided in his orderly, a simple natured Sikh from Ludhiana, that he (my friend) wished to buy a car but lacked funds to fulfill his wish.
        </p>
        <p>On the day when DIG came to the station the Orderly came to see the doctor.</p>
        <p>
            "Sir, I need your help urgently?" The orderly stood in front of my friend and looked at him with imploring eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Yes. Certainly if I am in a position to help you I will. What is it?" asked my friend.</p>
        <p>"Please get me posted to Leh. I shall always remain grateful to you for this favour".</p>
        <p>
            "But why? People generally want to get posted to a peace station and here you are asking me to get you posted to a forward station." My friend was genuinely surprised at the nature of his request.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sir I have many mouths to feed at home and when I am in Leh I shall save enough to be able to look after my family".
        </p>
        <p>
            My friend "looked after" his boss well and in return got his orderly transferred to Leh. However the next day the orderly came again and said that since he had taken a liking to my friend he does not wish to go to Leh. He just could not be persuaded to
            go to Leh now that the transfer order had been issued. My friend was truly caught in a cleft stick. He was the one who got his orderly transferred to Leh. Now to get it reversed would take some doing. So he invented a story. On the morning
            of DIG’s departure when he had been fed to his heart’s content, my friend went to him and said,<br> "Sir, I have made a mistake. When I recommended the transfer of my orderly I didn’t know that he was hypertensive. If he goes to
            a high altitude station it may not be good for his health."
        </p>
        <p>
            "What! You did not know this? What kind of a doctor you are?" barked the DIG.
        </p>
        <p>"I am sorry Sir. But you must cancel the order for his sake". Pleaded my friend</p>
        <p>
            "Okay I will. But you must be careful about these things". A typewriter was quickly summoned and a day old transfer order was cancelled.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fast forward to early nineties. My friend was on a visit to Pithoragarh on some official work. There he was informed that an old Sikh was making daily rounds of his office and enquiring after him and was being shooed away by the guards. So after his work
            was over, my friend summoned the old Sikh to his room. At first my friend did not recognize his old orderly from Kulu days.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sir, did you buy the car or not? You had mentioned that to me in Kulu." The old Sikh Orderly asked my friend after the initial pleasantries were over. My friend was surprised at the question.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No I did not. I got married and then had children. Was not able to save enough to buy a car." replied my friend.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sir wait for me. Don’t go away". Pleaded the old Sikh and went out of the room in a hurry.
        </p>
        <p>
            After about half an hour he came back with a small suitcase in which there was a bundle of cloth. He opened the suitcase and took out the bundle. He untied the bundle on the floor and put what must have been about Rs.50000-60000 cash on the bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sir take this money and buy a car that you always wanted to buy. I have saved this money out of my salary and it is all yours." The old Sikh pleaded with my friend to accept the cash.
        </p>
        <p>
            My friend almost choked with emotion. He did not know how to react. Here was a poor man who remembered a wish that his boss had casually mentioned over two decades ago, and wanted to fulfill it by contributing his life’s savings. My friend thanked him
            profusely and sent him back with his money and a small gift as a token of appreciation for what he did for him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Need I say more? Only if we were half as good as the old Sikh orderly the world would be infinitely a better place to live in.
