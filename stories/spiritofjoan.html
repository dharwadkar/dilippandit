        <p>
            Have you ever experienced the power of the unknown Mysterious Force (MF) guiding your action or destiny as it were? Or, have you ever felt that what you set out to do can’t be done because something intervened at the crucial time and prevented you from doing it? Did you ever feel that your life has been shaped more by what He disposes than by what you propose?
        </p>
        <p>
            On a recent visit to the Valley of Flowers in Uttarakhand (August 2001), I certainly felt that I was destined to do a certain thing that I had wish to do. In retrospect, I feel that at least on four occasions, an invisible hand removed the road blocks that had been placed in my way, although I did not realise it at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your curiosity isn’t sufficiently aroused then read on. Inspired by an article on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_Flowers_National_Park">Valley of Flowers</a>, that appeared in the Statesman on Jan 24, 2001, I decided to visit the valley not only to savour its bewitching and breathtaking natural beauty; to admire a great profusion of diverse flowers that the valley plays host to in the rainy season, but also to pay my respects to the intrepid Joan Margaret Legge, an English botanist, who lost her life in the Valley of Flowers in the year 1938 in an accident and is buried in the Valley. Apparently a small and an unpretentious grave was dug up to bury her and a tombstone erected in her memory. What is amazing about this lady is the fact that at 53 she went to the Valley over 60 years ago to study its fauna and flora when the conditions would most certainly have been far worse than what they are today. And the conditions that exist today are nothing to write home about. I really wonder what prompted her to come to India, proceed to one of its remotest corner and study it’s flora. Whatever may be her reasons, her decision to go to the Valley of Flowers in 1930s was both courageous and risky.
        </p>
        <p>
            So off we event, I with my family and a friend with his. Together a group of seven persons. The plan was to spend two full days at Ghangaria – a small village 4 kms from Valley of Flowers and 6 kms from Hemkund Sahib. One day each was set apart for the Valley and for Hemkund Sahib. One can reach Ghangaria either on foot or on horseback from Govindghat (about 20 Kms from Joshimath) by covering a distance of 13 kms that takes one from 6000 feet to close to 10000 feet above mean sea level. When we started from Govindghat the weather was fine but soon thereafter it started to pour cats and dogs and by the time we reached Ghangaria 7 hours later we were completely drenched and tired. There was no map of the valley anywhere in the village that could enable us to locate the grave of the Botanist in the valley. Even the forest guards, who had set up a check post at the entrance of Nandadevi National Park, or Biosphere as it is now called, had only a vague idea. The only clue that I had was the information given in the article that appeared in the newspaper. It said that the grave was 1 km to the east of the main pathway. Since the valley is 10 kms long, that hardly gave any solace.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next day was sunny. But we had learnt the previous day that the only thing that is certain in the hills is the uncertainty of the weather. So all of us had something or the other to protect us from the rain. The footpath that led us to the valley wound its way through high rise green vegetation out of which rose tall and handsome deodar trees that seemed to compete with mountains for attention. The birds and insects were abuzz and the sound of silence, that one can only hear in the mountains or forests at night, was occasionally disturbed by the call of a mynah or a barbet that echoed in the valley. There were about a dozen waterfalls that dived from the mountain cliffs to embrace river Pushpavati that meanders through the valley. We had been trekking for almost two and a half hours and still there was no sign of the valley. It was almost noon. We were advised to turn back and reach Ghangaria by 3 as the weather normally gets worse by late afternoon in the month of August. The progress was of necessity slow, as there were ladies and children in our party who needed frequent breaks for rest. Thousands of marina longifolia, primulas, germaniums, potentillas, polygonum and other flowers were in full bloom. It was a magnificent sight. The log-bridge, from where the valley actually begins was still half a kilometre away. I had to hurry if I were to pay visit to the grave. No one else in our party was keen on visiting the grave of an unknown botanist as that would have meant walking another 4-5 km without any assurance that one could see it. So leaving the rest of the party to catch breath and enjoy the sights, smells and sounds of the valley, I started to walk fast to get to the log bridge built over a stream running down from the mountains. The bridge came and went and still there was no sign of any footpath leading to the grave. Meanwhile clouds began to rise from the valley and threatened to cover it and pour down. They put paid to my plans. With a heavy heart I turned back and joined the party. While going back I made up my mind to come back to the valley next year and visit the grave.
        </p>
        <p>
            However MF intervened yet again in the form of rain that night. Because of it the next day’s programme of going to Hemkund Sahib was modified and I was asked to stay with children in Ghangaria so that they do not feel bad about having to cool off their heels while ladies went on a pilgrimage to Hemkund Sahib. However no sooner had I seen off the ponies that carried them to Hemkund Sahib than the weather suddenly opened up. For the second time MF intervened to clear up the weather. Since I was at a loose end, I decided to make most of the opportunity and go back to the valley in search of the tombstone. I asked my son whether he wished to come with me. Surprisingly and thankfully he declined. For had he on agreed to come it just wouldn’t have been possible to cover a distance of 8-10 kms in two and a half hours. So carrying an umbrella, a couple of sandwiches, a water bottle and a camera, I started walking to the valley. Since I was alone this time it was possible to cover a distance of 4 kms up the hill in less than 2 hours. On my way I managed to locate a cicada sitting on the trunk of a tree making eerie sound and photographed it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Between periods of brief rest and brisk walk, I was occasionally overtaken by a group of three young men that appeared to have some particular interest in the valley. For they also went a couple of kilometres further than the log-bridge – very few people venture to do that. By now I had covered a distance of 2-3 kms and still the pathway leading to the grave was as elusive as ever. The only thing going in my favour was the weather that remained extremely friendly till the end. Presently I came across a large and 30 feet wide mountain stream. It was strewn with slippery boulders of all shapes and sizes that were submerged under a foot of fast flowing water. I spent nearly 10 minutes trying to find a way to ford the stream. Encumbered as I was with a camera, I was hesitant to take any rash step that might be risky. Then I walked back to the small raised mound from which the path led to the stream and surveyed the valley in search of any telltale signs of the grave. The view of the valley from that point was magnificent. The valley progressed from my left to the right. Behind me was the Nar Mountain that separates the Valley of Flowers from the Badrinath valley. On the left was Ratanban peak, on my right was the pathway leading to the stream, and in front of me was the Gauri parbat. The valley was about 2 kms wide and there was a beautiful open grassland in front of me about a kilometre away. Somewhere in the middle of that open grassland, my eyes spotted a small saffron flag – a speck on the large canvas that was before me – fluttering in the breeze. For the first time I cursed myself for not bringing my old but trusted 7X37 Bushnell binocular that would have solved the mystery of the fluttering flag in a jiffy. While I was debating about what to do, the three men whom I had overtaken a few minutes ago accosted me. They were also trying to find the pathway leading to the grave. I told them about the stream and the difficulty of crossing it. One of them appeared to be a hardcore trekker. He went down the mound to have a look at the stream. While he was gone, his friend told me that if there is a way to cross a stream, he would surely find it. After about 10 minutes he came back from the stream and told us that it would be difficult and risky to cross the stream and we might as well abandon the plan. This was a big blow. For I had counted on these men to pool in their experience to come out with something innovative. I decided to pack up for the day and turn back. Hardly had I gone for 5 minutes when one of them called and asked me to come back. This was the third time the MF intervened. The men said that they didn’t want to give up so easily and would like to make an attempt anyway. All four of us descended back to the stream and tried to locate the safest way to cross the stream come what may.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile we all noticed that from the other side of the stream a young lanky Sikh in flowing blue coloured kaftan like garment wearing an orange turban was coming our way. He had a long stick, or a spear, in one hand. Probably he was going to Hemkund Sahib. But from where he was coming we had no clue. As there appeared to be no settlement on the other side of the stream in the valley. He had by now reached the stream and most casually started to cross it with the help of stick in one hand. He did it so deftly that we all wondered at his marvellous skill. That gave us some inspiration to cross the stream.
        </p>
        <p>
            By now I was determined to cross the stream. I rolled up my jeans, slung camera round my neck a little tighter and stared to cross the stream by resting both hands on the rocks to balance the body. I almost crawled across the stream with a lump in my throat. It wasn’t a life-threatening risk, but were I to lose my balance, I would have considered my self lucky to end up in a hospital with a couple of major cracks in bones. In the end, I managed to safely cross the stream and asked the other men to follow suit. They dilly-dallied for a few minutes after which I left them to their devices and continued to walk in the general direction of the flag.
        </p>
        <p>
            After about 20 minutes of brisk walk, I was standing near the grave of the great lady. A sense of profound satisfaction and achievement came over me. I felt as if I was destined to come to this place and pay my respect. I plucked a Geranium flower and placed it on the broken slab of her grave and stood silently for about 5-10 minutes in that vast valley with no one around for miles. At around the same time the Sun had come out and bathed the valley in its splendid golden sunshine. It was an amazing experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            The condition of her grave shocked me. It was in dilapidated state and the slab on top of it was broken. Dried flowers and an apple were testimony to the fact that Ms. Legge was not unknown in this part of the world even six decades after her death. The epitaph on her grave described what she was and what interested her most.
        </p>
        <p class="centered">
            <em>
                “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, <br>
                Whence cometh my strength”
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            It was just as well that she was buried in the Valley of Flowers from where she derived her strength.
        </p>
        <p>
            On my way back to the Guest house in Ghangaria, I pondered over how Providence or the Mysterious Force, call it what you may, desired that I visit the grave. When I had almost given up the idea of going further, how the MF has suddenly taken the form of one of the men who had called me back and gave me inspiration and strength to cross the stream. And the sudden appearance of the young Sikh. I call it the Spirit of Joan.
