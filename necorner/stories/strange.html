        <h2>An encounter with a strange Monk</h2>
        <p>
            This story is set in Arunachal Pradesh which has a fairly large Buddhist population in the Western and Eastern parts of the state.
        </p>
        <p>
            The year was 2011 and by this time I had already spent more than 3 years in the state. Since I was nearing the end of my tenure I wanted to see as much of the remaining parts of the state as possible, time permitting. My wife had come to join me in the
            summer of that year and we were on a visit to the oil town of Digboi. This town is essentially an oil town where oil was first discovered in India and an oil well drilled. The bungalows, typically double storied half concrete and half wooden
            structures, sit on top of 30’ high earthen mounds with acres of open spaces, interspersed with trees, around them. Each bungalow is separated from the other by at least half a kilometre. Of particular interest is Bungalow no 71 which is given
            to guests of Assam Government. We stayed in that Bungalow for a couple of days before leaving for Jairampur and thence to Indo-Myanmar Border by driving down on the old and historic (now relaid with blacktop) Stilwell Road.
        </p>
        <p>
            We saw the Oil Museum and then decided to meet one Mr. Dolloi who worked as Asst. Manager (Corporate Communications) with Indian Oil Corporation. During the chat with him I noticed that he wore a strange looking ring on his forefinger which had two stones
            joined together and was worn with stones pointing towards the palm. A rather curious apparition and a strange way to wear it.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That is a strange kind of ring you are wearing Mr. Dolloi?" I said in a tone that conveyed my curiosity more than my observation.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes that is give to me by Bhante Baba of Buddhist Monastery at Ledo. This is a powerful stone and has magical powers." He said with conviction that bordered on devotion handing me over Baba’s telephone number on a slip of paper that I kept casually in
            my pocket.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was interested. This monastery at Ledo is in Assam for Khamti tribals of Arunchal Pradesh and is in the middle of a coal mining area. It lies between Margarita and Jairampur towns. The former in Assam and the latter in Arunachal Pradesh.
        </p>
        <p>
            After we had left Digboi for Jairampur later that day we rolled past rice fields set amid sylvan surroundings. After about an hour or so I noticed a board announcing the existence of a Buddhist Monastery of Khamti tribe. Nauluong Monastery was the name
            if my memory serves me right. It was 5 kms from the main road and an air strip of WW II vintage also existed on the road about a kilometre down the road to the monastery. The brief conversation that I had with Mr. Dolloi sprang in my memory
            and I decided to meet this monk who appeared to possess magical powers more out of curiosity than any wish to get a ring from him. I reckoned I had enough to time to meet him for about half an hour and reach Jairampur by evening.
        </p>
        <p>
            We drove past the country side hoping to find some sign of the red and gold coloured monastery rising above rice fields in the countryside. We kept on driving past the air strip and at the end of a narrow road just past fields and houses we came to a
            cul-de-sac. On our left was an open enclosure of about 1000 sq yards in which there was a Chorten and a idol of Buddha on a pedestal. I was surprised to find that there was no one around it. On our right was a house where a small boy was sweeping
            the floor of the courtyard. We gingerly entered the main gate and found 6-7 Pomeranian type dogs sitting on the steps leading to the main veranda. There were many more such dogs in the basement. The dogs surprisingly didn’t bark at us perhaps
            used to visitors coming frequently to meet the Baba.
        </p>
        <p>
            We then saw a white horse in the large hall next to the landing area and a man was tending to it. This was weird. What were so many dogs and a horse doing there? We wondered. Then a boy came towards us looking puzzled.
        </p>
        <p>
            "We have come to see Bhante Baba". I told him.
        </p>
        <p>
            "One of our dogs has died and the Baba is busy burying him." The boy informed us.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was now not sure whether we had done the right thing in taking this diversion to meet the Baba but having come so far and spent about an hour looking for his abode, I thought let us press on and at least see him.
        </p>
        <p>
            So we decided to wait for a few more minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Please wait in the hall on the first floor. Baba will be there shortly to meet you." The man tending to the horse told us.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was now worried that this tryst with Baba would delay us. But then it wouldn’t look nice if just left without meeting this strange Baba when he knew that we had come to see him and left without telling him.
        </p>
        <p>
            So we went to the first floor and waited for the Baba. Minutes slowly ticked by and when even after 15 minutes no one came to meet us we decided to leave. That was when we saw the Baba. He was frail looking old man in his sixties, wore crimson robes and
            had shriveled face with stained teeth. He sported a few days stubble that covered his chin. He spoke neither Hindi nor English but managed to speak a few common words of Hindi in a manner that it was difficult to make out what he meant. He
            managed to convey to us to wait in the study room near the first floor landing.
        </p>
        <p>
            This rectangular study of Baba was filled with rows of sofa sets arranged on either side with Baba’s Chair, I presumed, at one corner of the room. He came after 5 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I noticed that he had very thin hands and fingers. He spoke in Hindi that I barely could understand. When he said "Samajha" - meaning, "Did you understand?" in Hindi it sounded like "Samasya". I thought that he wanted to know if I had any problem for
            which I came to meet him. But later I understood that he wanted to know if I understood what he said to me. But that revelation came after there were some awkward moments in conversation with him.
        </p>
        <p>
            He said that we must keep in mind three instructions about the stone that he will give us.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    When we are talking to someone in authority and making the other person understand one’s point of view we must press the stone worn on the ring finger of our right hand with thumb and remember Buddha and Baba and seek his blessings for successful interaction
                    with the person with whom we are discussing an issue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When someone out of jealousy gives poisoned or drugged food, the hand wearing the stone will automatically shake indicating that the food is not fit to eat or something will happen that will prevent us from eating that food.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whenever one bleeds from nose, or one feels depressed or uncomfortable one must dip the stone in a glass of water and drink it.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>"Samasya?" He asked.</p>
        <p>
            "Yes". I replied feeling like a complete idiot by this time.
        </p>
        <p>
            He then got up, opened a small box, took out 2 pea sized golden coloured stones and put one on my right palm below the ring finger. Then he slightly pressed it, mumbled a few prayers and gave it. He asked me to wear it with stone on the side of palm so
            that my thumb could touch it.
        </p>
        <p>He followed similar routine with my wife and gave her three stones. Two more for our children.</p>
        <p>
            He then asked us to keep Rs. 200/- on the mantelpiece near small Buddha idol and asked us to ensure that the person who makes the rings does it in our presence.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we got up to leave he gave me an apple, Suchita an apple and 2 sweet lemons. We bowed and left wondering what on earth was this all about, not wanting to believe all this but feeling in the core of our heart this weird Baba must be some saint with
            magical powers or a con man. I am still trying to figure it out.
        </p>
        <p>
            PS: Later I saw a colleague, a young tribal IAS officer with similar ring and he said that Bhante Baba gave it to him. I later learnt that the word "Bhante" in Pali means "Venerable Sir".
