        <h2>My Feathered Friend</h2>
        <h3>Written in Itanagar Arunachal Pradesh in January 2010</h3>
        <p>
            Every day I watch a feathered friend of mine the first thing in the morning. The regularity with which it makes appearance, sits on the electric wire that stretches across the street in front of my house makes me feel special. I feel elated and happy.
            A kind of bond has developed between us that I feel has no rational explanation. Bond? What Bond you might well ask. Bonds are forged between two emotional beings and not with a feathered creature you rightly argue. But when I do not see it,
            my heart skips a beat, and I then think of thousand ways in which this creature could have ended its journey in this world.
        </p>
        <img class="art-img left" src="/img/greybackedshrike.jpeg" alt="Grey Backed Shrike" />
        <p>
            I first made acquaintance with this friend about a few months back when I saw it sitting on the wire. I took out my binocular and saw what it was. Then I took out my camera and photographed it from all possible angles. I can now tell this specimen from
            thousands of its cousins in the city. It is fairly active in the morning and in the early winter would screech away to glory sitting on a branch of a tree right next to my bedroom. At 4 o’clock in the morning mind you. I would pull my quilt
            over my head and pretend that I am asleep. But it would elude me. And that would be the end of my night’s rest. I would have to get up per force and be on my feet.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would naturally be angry and disturbed at having been woken up so early. (Even as I write this I see it sitting on the wire mesh that defines the boundary of the plot on which this house is built telling me, in his own language that I only seem to understand,
            that he agrees with what I write). But then the anger would melt away slowly. I would come out of the house and follow its forays in the bushes in search of its early morning breakfast. Its dexterity in doing that job is worth a clap. It would
            come down from a high perch to a bush, wait for some time there and all of a sudden would swoop down on an unwary insect – of which there are hundreds of varieties in this magical land – and fly away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the winter it would come and honour me with its presence in the morning. Then for a couple of weeks it did not come. I felt ill at ease. Then to my delight it came back on its usual position telling me that it is a free bird and has every right
            to do what it pleases. I plead with him that even though it is free and busy as a bee, it can surely take some time off to say “Good morning” to me. He just flew away without so much as a nod.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what it did not do in words it did in action. For the last few days despite incessant heavy rains, it kept its promise and stayed perched on the wire dripping from head to tail till I came out in the verandah and acknowledged its presence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well-done and thank you Grey-backed shrike!! If only human beings could be as faithful and kind as you, the world would be a better place to live in.
