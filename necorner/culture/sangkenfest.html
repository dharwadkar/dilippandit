        <h2>The Festival of Sangken</h2>
        <p>
            The Festival of Sangken is celebrated in Arunachal Pradesh and parts of Assam in India as a traditional New Year’s Day from 14 to 16 April every year.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was privileged to stay in a house that was directly opposite the Therwada Buddhist Monastry in Itanagar. So. I was in a position to observe the hectic preparations that went on in the monastery on this important festival in the year 2010.
        </p>

        <p>
            The following is the excerpt from my diary of 14 April 2010.
        </p>
        <p class="itabold">
            The monastery in front was the centre of feverish activity. The Management of the Monastery is preparing the place for the festival of Sankgen. It is celebrated by Hinayana Buddhism mainly from Lohit and Changlang district in Arunachal Pradesh. Khamati, Singpho and Tangsas tribes from Arunachal Pradesh follow this sect of Buddhism.
        </p>
        <p class="itabold">
            The supervisor at the place told me that they get annual calendar of events from Burmese Buddhists and also prognostications about weather and calamites that might befall them. I asked him whether they had predicted last year’s drought. Didn’t get convincing answer.
        </p>
        <p class="itabold">
            As I mentioned earlier they had decorated a hexagonal cage 4’ high into which outfall of a boat like structure had been released. The water from the outfall fell on to a spindle into which were fixed in all directions pipes that were punctured with holes at 2” intervals. As the water from the boat like channel flowed it rotated the spindle and through the holes the water came out and sprayed on the idols placed below. All of them lit candles and burnt incense sticks and placed them near the hexagonal structure. I smelt the sweet fragrance of the incense sticks all day as the easterly wind brought it to my home.
        </p>
        <p class="itabold">
            In the morning at exactly 0928 the idols (about 25-30) of varying sizes from 4” to 8” were brought by men with due ceremony from inside the temple and placed in the cage. Prayers were chanted and men, women and children poured water from buckets into the channel of the boat like structure. This ceremony took place simultaneously at the same time in Thailand, Burma and China.
        </p>
        <p class="itabold">
            The idols were facing south which is the direction of evil as per their belief. By placing them thus the evil was warded off.
        </p>
        <p class="itabold">
            They had also selected a Nahar (Mesua Ferrea) tree to which was tied a string which extended inside the temple and touched their sacred texts and the main idol. And they poured water on to that tree. By doing so they believed they were also purifying text and the idol which couldn’t have been bathed in water..
        </p>
        <p class="itabold">
            This went on for two hours. After that the activity slackened a bit. But throughout the day young men and women sprayed water on each other. More so in the evening. This is theoretically supposed to go on till Friday non stop till 1338 hrs when the idols would once again be placed back ceremoniously in the temple. But since water is scarce and not many Khamti and Singpo community members are staying in Itanagar this non stop spraying of water does stop at night and even during day.
