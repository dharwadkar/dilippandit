        <h2>The Festival of Sangken</h2>
        <p>
            The Festival of Sangken is celebrated in Arunachal Pradesh and parts of Assam in India as a traditional New Year’s Day from 14 to 16 April every year.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was privileged to stay in a house that was directly opposite the Therwada Buddhist Monastry in Itanagar. So. I was in a position to observe the hectic preparations that went on in the monastery on this important festival in the year 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following is the excerpt from my diary of 14 April 2010.
        </p>
        <p class="itabold">
            The monastery in front was the centre of feverish activity. The Management of the Monastery is preparing the place for the festival of Sankgen. It is celebrated by Hinayana Buddhism mainly from Lohit and Changlang district in Arunachal Pradesh. Khamati, Singpho and Tangsas tribes from Arunachal Pradesh follow this sect of Buddhism.

                On the first day we got up at 5 am in the morning thinking that we would catch birds at the first light. But imagine our shock when we found, as we opened our tent flaps, that the Sun was shining as brightly as it would at 7 am in Delhi in June. Although
                we could hear the calls of birds as we lay on our beds, the darkness inside the tent gave us a false sense of darkness outside it. After that we decided to get up at 4 am and be out by 4.30 am. First lesson in birding in EWS learnt at
                no great cost. Even my co-birders who were not new to EWS were taken aback.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sky was azure and the Sun mildly warm. I found that one of my co-birder was wearing a thin hand glove that did not make any sense to me at all. When queried he said that it was worn to protect the hand from attacks by small insects that buzz all around
                one. These insects bit my hand several times but in the excitement of watching birds, one tends to ignore small pinpricks. But now as I sit back in my home keying in this report, both my hands and feet are sore with small wounds caused
                by ticks initially and later by my mindless and stupid scratching of the bites.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the afternoon, Shashank led us to a couple of spots where the newest discovery that made Eaglenest famous among birding community all over the world, Bugun Liocichla, is generally seen. Try hard as he might with the bird’s recorded calls; it did not
                come out of its self-imposed territorial restriction. Dejected we all started walking back to our camp in darkness. However the disappointment of not being able to see the “star” bird was somewhat mitigated by the fortuitous catch of three
                snakes in a space of half an hour. Shashank is an expert catcher of all reptiles. Two of these snakes were Trachischium monticola – a harmless variety. They were about 18 inches long. The third snake most probably was a keelback (?). These
                snakes were handled by the Shashank as if they were pieces of thick cotton ropes. When we reached the Lama camp another bottle was brought in which was kept a monocled cobra about 15” long. It is reported that no anti-venom drug has been
                produced to counter the effect of its highly venomous and deadly bite. This cobra was again caught by Shashank near Ramlingam village.
            </p>
            <p>
                We finally managed to see Bugun Liocichla the next day in the morning near the nallah about 4 km from Lama camp towards Ramlingam village. It was a male and a beautiful bird to boot. A little further ahead we saw black-tailed crake near Ramlingam village.
                It responded beautifully to its call. Without Shashank it would have been difficult to see either bird.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first night was devoted to an experiment which Ramana Athreya devised. He hung a white cotton sheet about 4 feet X 4 feet size in an open ground and lit a 100 W bulb on the top of it. Within half an hour scores of moths were clinging to the white
                sheet. Some of these moths were 6 inch large and some tiny. But wing patterns and colours of all these moths were so beautiful that both Ramana and Sondhi kept on taking their photographs well into the night. Their zeal infected me too
                and I too found myself taking photographs of moths that I found were extraordinarily large or beautiful.
            </p>
            <p>
                My best birding was in the area around Bompu camp. The place is teeming with birds and most of them great skulkers. Two birds that gave me trouble no end in Itanagar were finally seen here. Rufous capped babbler and grey bellied tesia – thanks to the
                playback facility. The latter was seen just briefly but it came close before going back in thick cover. The 13 km walk through dense forest from Bompu to Sessni was a most unforgettable experience. Out of this world. The forest cover was
                so thick on either side of the valley that one kept asking oneself time and again whether it was for real. And how many species of birds, reptiles, amphibians, butterflies could these forests be hiding in their bosom - waiting to be discovered.
                And to cap the ethereal experience was the languorous floating of misty clouds through which one passed time and again. All this made photography impossible but no one was complaining. My co-birder, Sondhi an IITK alumnus, who gave up
                an attractive corporate job at a young age of 43 to pursue his passion for wildlife was at a loss to decide whether to look up for birds or to look down for frogs, lizards, butterflies and snakes of which he collected a sizable number
                of specimen for scientific study. He kept the frogs captured by him in bags and brought them to his tent. Since my tent was next to his, I heard the croaking of frogs all night that was made by his prisoners more in protest at being held
                under bag arrest without so much as by your leave, than in any other emotion. Or so I believe. When I told him, in a tone that was a strange mixture of request and command, to release the poor creatures, he replied a little indignantly
                by telling me not to talk to him like his wife (!!) who also apparently pesters him for keeping all manner of wildlife in his house for jotting down their sizes and other taxonomic details and makes life hell for him for not releasing
                them back in their original habitat which he eventually does as soon as he notes down the details and photographs them. I have yet see a more indefatigable birder and wildlife enthusiast. He would be out of camp at 4 in the morning after
                partaking of most frugal breakfast and would remain on shank’s mare birding and collecting specimen of butterflies, toads and frogs till evening without any food during the day. He would then have dinner before resuming his work of photographing
                his catch and noting down taxonomic details. And only thereafter would he hit the sack at 10 pm in the night.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond Sissni lies the Hodgson’s frogmouth zone. And we went there more out of curiosity than in any real expectation of seeing the bird. There was a path or what looked like a path that took one down a steep slope through a bamboo grove to the location
                where this nocturnal bird is usually seen. But by the time we reached this place we were tired, but not our bird guide, Tenspo Tesring, who was surprised at out refusal to go down the path with him. He thought we were crazy. But I knew
                that a false and careless step on a loose boulder could take one tumbling down the slope with no hope of medical attention for miles around. So “thanks but no thanks” was our reply to his entreaties. He went alone down the slope, played
                the call several times to no avail and came out only after we told him that we would very much like to reach the camp before night fall.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last morning was the most productive of all. It was sunny and there was a pleasant nip in the air. We walked for about 3 hours during which we saw many birds among which was green cochoa. Its coloration is different from the one given in the illustration
                in Inskipp. Its cheek is white and not green. My guide told me that one Englishman has taken its photo and would get the plate corrected after talking to the authors of the book.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thereafter I left Eaglenest. I missed out seeing Hodgson’s Frogmouth, Blue-fronted Robin, Ward’s Trogan, Slender-billed scimitar babbler and pygmy wren babbler and many more. When I mentioned the list of birds I could not see to Ramana he said that if
                you see everything you want to see in the first visit, there would be no motivation to come for a repeat visit. One does not need a list of missed birds to pay a second visit to Eaglenest!! You are hooked for life.
